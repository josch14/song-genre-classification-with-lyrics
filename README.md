# song-lyrics-classification
Song genre classification of songs using lyrics.

## Installation
```
conda create -n song_classification python=3.8
conda activate song_classification

conda install -c anaconda pandas 
conda install -c conda-forge tqdm 

# ensure only english songs in the dataset
conda install -c conda-forge spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
pip install spacy-langdetect

# model implementation
conda install -c anaconda tensorflow
conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn 
pip install more-itertools

# text preprocessing
conda install -c anaconda nltk 
pip install contractions

# plots
pip install matplotlib
conda install -c anaconda seaborn 

# fix occuring errors
pip install numpy==1.19.5
python -m pip install PyQt5
```

## Dataset
This repository already contains the processed dataset used in this work. These can be generated by downloading the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neisse/scrapped-lyrics-from-6-genres, and put the two files into `./data/`. Afterwards, run 
```
python build_datasets.py
```

Some dataset analysis can be made using 
```
python analyze_dataset.py
```

Also make sure that the `./data/` folder contains the GloVe word vectors (`glove.6B.50d.txt`) and (`glove.6B.100d.txt`), available at https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/.


## Model Training
The six different methods can be trained using the following commands. These will run training on all 11 datasets, containing 2 up to 12 genres, and save the logs and achieved metric performances directly to a text file. Note that no model weights are saved to disk at any time.

```
python .\train.py -m naive_bayes_bernoulli > results/results_naive_bayes_bernoulli.txt
python .\train.py -m naive_bayes_multinomial > results/results_naive_bayes_multinomial.txt
python .\train.py -m svm > results/results_svm.txt
python .\train.py -m mlp_glove -lr 1e-3 > results/results_mlp_glove_1e-3.txt
python .\train.py -m lstm_glove -lr 1e-3 > results/results_lstm_glove_1e-3.txt
python .\train.py -m lstm -lr 1e-3 > results/results_lstm_1e-3.txt
```

## Generate metric plots and tables
The achieved metric performances from training were manually written to a json file (see `./evaluation/results_overview.json`). Based on this, the following command generates metric plots prints performance tables for LaTeX.
```
python show_results.py
```

## Detailed evaluation
The following commands allow a more detailed model evaluation (generate metrics per musical genre, and generate confusion matrix):
```
python evaluate_model.py -m naive_bayes_bernoulli
python evaluate_model.py -m naive_bayes_multinomial
python evaluate_model.py -m svm 
python evaluate_model.py -m mlp_glove -lr 1e-3
python evaluate_model.py -m lstm_glove -lr 1e-3
python evaluate_model.py -m lstm -lr 1e-3
```
