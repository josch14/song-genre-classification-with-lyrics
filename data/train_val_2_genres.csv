Pop,"Swollen eyes
No better to let you see them now
My wasted heart
Will never let you
drive the demon down

When you love the devil
You'll sell your soul
And it's hard to make him go
Undignified
I am tonight

CHORUS:
So give me false, hope and promise
Near You're trying to
Redeem yourself for the Hundredth Time
Lasoo me in if you must My dear
Give me a reason to have you here
Giving false, hope and lies
And we still belief it
This powerful love that's comsuming me
Hooked on a drug that's still your pride
It's hard not to see
So undignified

It terrefies me
to think i'm not the only one
You'd be suprised
How much I cry when you are gone

Your angels the devil
Your church is a tomb
But I need to be with you
I'm undignified
Enough for two

CHORUS:
So give me false, hope and promise
Near You're trying to
Redeem yourself for the Hundredth Time
Lasoo me in if you must My dear
Give me a reason to have you here
Giving false, hope and lies
And we still belief it
This powerful love that's comsuming me
Hooked on a drug that's still your pride
It's hard not to see
So undignified

I'm addicted to the blatnant
pleasure you give
That's not how i wanna live
Controlled by you

CHORUS:
So give me false, hope and promise
Near You're trying to
Redeem yourself for the Hundredth Time
Lasoo me in if you must My dear
Give me a reason to have you here
Giving false, hope and lies
And we still belief it
This powerful love that's comsuming me
Hooked on a drug that's still your pride
It's hard not to see
So undignified"
Rock,"There'll never be anyone else but you for me
Never ever be just couldn't be
Anyone else but you

If I could take my pick of all the girls
I've ever known
Then I'd come and pick you out to be my very own

There'll never be anyone else but you for me
Never ever be just couldn't be
Anyone else but you


I never will forget the way you kissed me
And when we're not together I wonder if you miss me
'Cause I hope and I pray the day will come
When you belong to me then I am gonna prove to you
How true my love can be

I never will forget the way you kissed me
And when we're not together I wonder if you miss me
'Cos I hope and I pray the day will come
When you'll belong to me
'Cause then I'm gonna prove to you"
Rock,"I remember when you were his dog
I remember you under his thumb
Yeah baby, when he would call
Every time, you had to come

Hey, baby, you're a free girl now
Hey, baby, you're a free girl now

I remember when he was your boss
I remember him touching your butt
I remember you counting your blessings
Yeah honey, you had to keep your mouth shut

Hey baby, you're a free girl now
Yeah baby, you're a free girl now

Yeah, well all right
Honey, put your sugar down
Dazzle, dazzle the moon above
Lay your victim down

No longer will you be a slave
No longer will you have to crawl
No longer will you suffer
No longer will you stall
One day you'll live for a reason
One day you'll be gone, no more
When you walk from the table
No longer, will you bow down

Hey baby, you're a free girl now
Hey baby, you're a free girl now"
Pop,"It's ok
To go and make mistakes
It's ok
To break
Your promises
You're moving on any way

I hate the way
It makes me feel inside
You promised me
You'd be all that I need
I wonder why you lied

[Chorus]
Promises you made are comin' back to haunt you
Don't whisper in my ear
You gotta learn to say goodbye
I was in the wrong
But it doesn't really matter
Don't whisper in my ear
You gotta learn to say goodbye

It gave me time
To think about you and me
I hate the way
You make me feel inside
I wonder why you lied

[Chorus]

(Dadadadadadaa....)
I was breathing
'Cuz that's what the guage was indicating
What was bleeding?
I was soon to be so implicating
Now I'm through with all the lies and bitches I pactated
Almost lost my friendly fate
'Cuz, boy, I'm operatin'

(Uh uh uh uh uh uh....)

(Yey-ee yey-ee...)
Promises you made are comin' back to haunt you
Don't whisper in my ear
You gotta learn to say goodbye
I was in the wrong
But it doesn't really matter
Don't whisper in my ear
You gotta learn to say goodbye

(Promises you made...)
Promises you made are
(Comin' back to haunt you...)
Comin' back to haunt you
(Yey-ee yey-ee...)
Don't whisper in my ear
You gotta learn to say goodbye
(I was in the wrong...)
I was in the wrong
(But it doesn't really matter...)
But it doesn't really matter
Don't whisper in my ear (Learn to say goodbye...)
You gotta learn to say goodbye
(Promises you made...)
Promises you made are
(Comin' back to haunt you...)
Comin' back to haunt you
(Yey-ee yey-ee...)
Don't whisper in my ear
You gotta learn to say goodbye
(I was in the wrong...)
I was in the wrong
(But it doesn't really matter...)
But it doesn't really matter
Don't whisper in my ear (Learn to say goodbye...)
You gotta learn to say goodbye

You gotta learn to say goodbye

Rock,"Job's coffin looks down
Job's coffin looks down
To see what mankind is gonna do
There is a grid of disempowerment
And forces are being called to dismantle this

As job's coffin looks down
Job's coffin looks down
To see what you're gonna do

There exists a power of old
Who wanted earth to be controlled
But she and she alone is her own
She is her own

Job's coffin looks down
Job's coffin looks down
And can be proud
Proud of what I have done
Since time why do we women
Give ourselves away
We give ourselves away
Thinking somehow that will make him
Want to stay
Make him stay

Job's coffin looks down
At the day you shut your power down
You must out-create that distructive tendency
Let your fire starter hear the fury
Sister it's time to bring it back on line

As job's coffin looks down
Job's coffin looks down
To see what you're gonna do
To see what you're gonna do"
Rock,"It's late
We got to get on home
It's late
We been gone to long
Too bad
We should have checked the time
Can't phone
We done spent every dime

It's late
We're 'bout to run out of gas
It's late
We got to get home fast
Can't speed
We're in a slow down zone
Baby, look at that clock
Why can't it be wrong

Could've left home at a quarter to nine
Could've had fun in plenty of time
We got started just a little bit late
I hope this won't be our last date

Look up
Is that the moon we see
Can't be
Looks like the sun to me
It's late
I hate to face your dad
Too bad
I know he's gonna be mad

It's late
We got to get on home
It's late
We been gone to long"
Rock,"And in my dreams I see
All that is meant to be
I can't wait until tomorrow
'Cause lurking down below
There is an undertow
Waiting to bring you sorrow

And in my mind I see
Someone who can't be free
Trapped inside tour head in time
But you can't hold me down
I won't bow to your crown
I can't live in fear and anger

Oh, I don't wanna fall
I'm up against the wall
I'm gonna make it 'til tomorrow
Oh, I can hear the call
I'm giving it my all
I'm gonna make it
To a new tomorrow

The water's closing in
It's time to sink or swim
I turn my head and look
For land, but I am lost
Round and round I go
Caught in the undertow
I hold my hand out
And each for you
But you are gone

I've giving everything
There's nothing more to be
No expectation or desire
You're looking down on me
Something you'll never be
I'm flying higher

Oh, I don't wanna fall
I'm up against the wall
I'm gonna make it 'til tomorrow
Oh, I can her the call
I'm giving it my all
I'm gonna make it
To a new tomorrow"
Rock,"There goes my baby, there goes my only one.
I think she loves me, but she don't wanna let on.
Yeah, she likes to keep me guessin',
She's got me on the fence with that little bit of mystery,
She's a complex kid and she's always been so hard to figure out.
Yeah, she always likes to leave me with a shadow of a doubt.

Sometimes at night I wait around 'til she gets off.
She don't like workin', she says she hates her boss,
But she's got me askin' questions, she's got me on the fence
With that little certain something, she's a complex kid,
And she's always been so hard to get around.
She always likes to leave me with a shadow of a doubt.

Just a shadow of a doubt, she says it keeps me runnin'.
I'm trying to figure out if she's leadin' up to something
And when she's dreamin', sometimes she sings in French,
But in the morning, she don't remember it.

But she's got me thinking 'bout it,
Yeah, she's got me on the fence
With that little bit of mystery, she's a complex kid,
And she's always been so hard to live without.
Yeah, she always likes to leave me, with a shadow of a doubt."
Rock,"From 'Ogdens Nut Gone Flake'

There's wheat in the field
And water in the stream
And salt in the mine
And an aching in me.

I can longer stand and wonder
Cos I'm driven by this hunger.

So I'll jug some water, bake some flour,
Store some salt and wait the hour.

When thinking of love,
Love is thinking for me
And the baker will come
And the baker I'll be

I'm depending on my labour,
The texture and the flavour

Hey!

I can no longer stand and wonder
Cos I'm driven by this hunger

So I'll jug some water, bake some flour.
Store some salt and wait the hour."
Pop,"Everything Must Change

I'm beginning to get a little tired
Of the misconceived idea
Of who you seem to think I am
Although it looks that this come easy
You know for well I've had my problems
And I've cried

Don't be so quick to criticize me
Don't dismiss me out of hand

It's not over, simply changing
And no one is to blame
I believe in, what I'm feeling
And nothing stays the same
Everything must change

Could anything I say provoke you
Take a chance, go ahead try something new
Can you truly, hand in heart admit you feel good
About everything you say or do

I don't mean to criticize you
You just need to understand

It's not over, simply changing
And no one is to blame
Just believe in, what you're feeling
Cos nothing stays the same
No don't fight it, don't deny it
You'll find yourself again
Just believe in, what you're feeling
'Cos nothing stays the same
Everything must change

Are we so different after all?
Everything must change

It's not over, simply changing
And no one is to blame
Just believe in, what you're feeling
Cos nothing stays the same
No don't fight it, don't deny it
You'll find yourself again
Just believe in, what you're feeling
'Cos nothing stays the same

It's not over
Simply changing
No don't fight it
Don't deny it

Everything must change"
Rock,"Woke up into a dream
And I was walking
Up and down the streets
Of Cairo


And then I heard a voice
That said I know you
Itâ€™s time for you to turn
And face me


Her hair was long
Her eyes reached out and touched me
She said I know just
What it is youâ€™re after


Death is all around you
So you look for freedom
I know where to find it
Letâ€™s go to the river


We sailed upon the Nile
I was enchanted
By the beauty in her magic
She showed me that my fears were unimportant
And then she touched me
With her vision


Her skin was dark
Her voice was liquid fire
She said I am your mate
And soulâ€™s desire


Love is all around you
Light is deep within you
Life is always flowing"
Rock,"Dirty old street, all slushed up in the rain and snow.
Little boy and his ma,
standin' outside a run-down music store window.
On top of the Christmas tree shines one beautiful star,
and lyin' underneath, a brand new Japanese guitar.

I remember in the mornin' Ma, hearin' your alarm clock ring.
I'd lie awake and listen to you gettin' ready for work,
the sound of your makeup case on the sink.
And the ladies at the office, all silk stockin's and rustlin' skirts.
And how proud and happy you always looked, walkin' home from work.

Well if Pa's eyes were windows, into a world so deadly and true,
you couldn't stop me from lookin', but you kept me from crawlin' through.
Well it's a funny old world Ma,
where a little boy's wishes come true.
Well I got a few in my pocket, and a special one just for you.

It ain't no phone call on Sunday, flowers, or a Mother's day card.
It ain't no house on the hill, with a garden and a nice little yard.
I got my hot rod down on Bond Street,
I'm older but you'll know me at a glance.
We'll find us a rock 'n roll bar, baby we'll go out and dance.

Well it was me in my Beatle boots, you in pink curlers and matador pants,
gettin' up in the livin' room, to do the twist for my uncles and aunts.
Well I got a girl of my own now Ma,
yeah, we're doin' OK.
And I've been workin' up the nerve, to say what it is I got to say.

Last night we sat around laughin', at all those things that guitar brought
us,
and I laid awake thinkin' about the other things it's brought.
Well tonight I'm takin's requests here in the kitchen,
this one's for you, let me come right out and say,
that if you're lookin' for a sad song, well, I'm not gonna play
"
Pop,"I see you walk by, extra fly baby
Where you going can I roll?
(Is it cool if I come with you baby?)
Living beach life, feeling right
You're the hottest everybody knows

Burnin' up, burnin' up
Show em' what you got, yeah you got it baby let it show
Just turn it up, turn it up
Let me know what's up
Don't just stand there girl I gotta know

Say somethin' if you're feeling the vibe
Say somethin' baby don't be so shy
Say somethin' cause you're all in my head like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah

Say somethin' cause you're driving me crazy
Say somethin' cause you're driving me wild
Say somethin' the way you're working it baby it's
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah

When we talk girl, fireworks something like the 4th of July
You're super hot, fire hot something like the sun in the sky
(Pretty hot babe)

Burnin' up, burnin' up
Show em' what you got, yeah you got it baby let it show
Just turn it up, turn it up
Let me know what's up
Don't just stand there girl I gotta know

Say somethin' if you're feeling the vibe
Say somethin' baby don't be so shy
Say somethin' cause you're all in my head like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah

Say somethin' cause you're driving me crazy
Say somethin' cause you're driving me wild
Say somethin' the way you're working it baby it's
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah

Hey baby tell me something lady
I gotta know what's up I gotta know right now
Hey baby tell me something lady
I gotta know what's up I gotta know right now

Say somethin' if you're feeling the vibe
Say somethin' baby don't be so shy
Say somethin' cause you're all in my head like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah

Say somethin' cause you're driving me crazy
Say somethin' cause you're driving me wild
Say somethin' the way you're working it baby it's
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah"
Rock,"Well it seems like I'm caught up in your trap again
And it seems like I'll be wearin' the same ol' chains
Good will conquer evil and the truth will set you free
Then I know someday I'll find the key
Then I know somewhere I'll find the key
Well it seem like I've been playin' the game way too long
And it seems the game I played has made you strong
Well when the game is over, I won't walk out a loser
And I know that I'll walk out of here again
And I know that someday I'll walk out of here again

But now I'm trapped...Oh yeah!
Trapped...Oh yeah yeah!
Trapped...Oh yeah!
Trapped...Oh yeah!

Now it seems like I've been sleepin' in your bed too long
And it seems like you've been meanin' to do me harm
But I'll teach my eyes to see beyond these walls in front of me
And someday I'll walk out of here again
Yeah I know someday I'll walk out of here again

(Chorus)

Well it seem like I've been playin' the game way too long
And it seems the game I played has made you strong

Because I'm trapped...Oh yeah!
Trapped...Oh yeah yeah!
Trapped...Oh yeah yeah!
Trapped...Oh yeah!

I'm trapped...Oh yeah yeah!
Trapped...Oh yeah yeah
Trapped...Oh yeahhhhhh
Trapped....oh yeahhhh
I'm trapped.
"
Pop,"I wanna play with fire

Even in the pouring rain
Even in the stars above
I'm here with you again
Even if we're not in love
We'll dance together in the dark
I know how to light the spark
I'm burning up with my desire
I wanna play with fire
Ah Ah Ah
I wanna play with fire
Ah Ah Ah

Ah, aah, ah, aah, ah, aah, ah, aah, ah [4 veces]

Guess this is where it all beging
When we let the music play
Wanna drag me in
Taste me like champagne
And let your hands go everywhere
On my body, through my hair
Your moves are so amazing
You know it makes me crazy
Ah Ah Ah
I wanna play with fire
Ah Ah Ah
I wanna play with fire

Ah, aah, ah, aah, ah, aah, ah, aah, ah [4 veces]

Don't stop it no, surrender to the beat just you and me
Just like it used to be, set your heart free when you surrender
Don't stop it no, cause I can feel the heat of you and me
Just like it used to be, set your heart free when you surrender

(I can barely breathe.......I can not believe
There's only you and me.....Moving
Desperatly.....Suddenly dance the dance)

Ah, aah, ah, aah, ah, aah, ah, aah, ah [4 veces]

(El beso.....Otro beso
Nada se compara...only you to me
Nothing means more to me)

And when we can't get enough
And history repeats
I only hear the sounds
Of your voice echoing
We'll do it all again somehow
Because it feels so good
We'll do the things that everybody-
Else wishes that they could

Don't stop it no, surrender to the beat just you and me
Just like it used to be, set your heart free when you surrender
Don't stop it no, cause I can feel the heat of you and me
Just like it used to be, set your heart free when you surrender
"
Rock,"Well you're the real tough cookie with the long history
Of breaking little hearts, like the one in me
That's O.K., lets see how you do it
Put up your dukes, lets get down to it!

Hit Me With Your Best Shot!
Why Don't You Hit Me With Your Best Shot!
Hit Me With Your Best Shot!
Fire Away!

You come on with a ""come on"", you don't fight fair
But that's O.K, see if I care!
Knock me down, it's all in vain
I'll get right back on my feet again!

Hit Me With Your Best Shot!
Why Don't You Hit Me With Your Best Shot!
Hit Me With Your Best Shot!
Fire Away!

Well you're the real tough cookie with the long history
Of breaking little hearts, like the one in me
Before I put another notch in my lipstick case
You better make sure you put me in my place

Hit Me With Your Best Shot!
Come On, Hit Me With Your Best Shot!
Hit Me With Your Best Shot!
Fire Away!

Hit Me With Your Best Shot!
Why Don't You Hit Me With Your Best Shot!
Hit Me With Your Best Shot!
Fire Away!"
Rock,"She has the innocence and vision of a child
How can I ever really know her?
Weâ€™re riding on a carousel
Thatâ€™s running wild
Around in circles â€˜til itâ€™s over


And every time we reach the end
We go around again â€˜cause


Chorus:
She canâ€™t let go
And I donâ€™t wanna tell her no
She canâ€™t let go
And I donâ€™t wanna tell her no


I see her starinâ€™ out the window at the rain
But she will never leave the fire
Sometimes it burns all night and covers up the pain
Sometimes it only leaves us tired


And every time we reach the end
We go around again â€˜cause"
Pop,"Don't dwell on the past
Of there was lost and didn't last
That summer bloom is fading fast
But I'm falling for you

Don't dwell on the pain
The tears you've cried
An autumn rain
That fair weather's here and gone again
But I'm waiting for you

Don't dwell on the loss
The fool that would steal break and toss
That winter's heart will spurn and double-cross
But I'm yearning for you

Don't dwell on the time
The seasons change
And so does the clime
That old flame has cooled
But I'm burning for you"
Pop,"If you're feeling low down cos your baby left town
Then let me set you straight
If the chicks flown the coup knock the blues for a loop
Get out and circulate

Go on out and have fun put the blues on the run
You'll find that livin's great
Just pretend you're a king bounce the world on a string
Get out and circulate

There are plenty of pebbles on the beach
Go out and gather a few
You can be the cats meow
Start your rock collection now

It's a star spangled world when your flags are unfurled
Don't under estimate
This advice that I give it means wake up and live
Get out and circulate

Music

There are plenty of fish in the deep blue sea
Shopping around for a mate
Hurry on up waste no time
Come on in the water's fine

It's a star spangled world when your flags are unfurled
Don't under estimate
This advice that I give it means wake up and live
Get out and circula..............te

It's a world full of chicks so get out and mix
I said that's life's worth a-livin' so get your kicks

Get out and circulate
"
Rock,"I know you hate me,
I see that now
If I was unhappy,
I'd be someone you could still care about
I think it's stupid and sad
That everything turned out so bad
And enemies make the most interesting friends

I'm gonna write you a long letter
I'm gonna get you on the telephone
Three little words to make it all better
Maybe I'll leave this whole thing alone

Oh, it's a sad, sad world
Without you in it
And I'm a bad, bad girl
For letting you down
And I remember every crazy minute
Oh, it's a sad, sad world
Without you around

We're too much alike
For our own good
We both hate fighting
No matter how misunderstood

Well, I want to tell you
That you're stubborn
And I want to tell you
I never lied
And I want to tell you
That your friends talk way too much
And I want to know
What happened to that friend of mine

Oh, it's a sad, sad world
Without you in it
And I was a bad, bad girl
For letting you down
And I remember every crazy minute
Oh, it's a sad, sad world
Without you around

Oh, it's a sad, sad world
Without you in it
And I'm a bad, bad girl
For letting you down
I remember every fucked up minute
Oh, it's a sad, sad world
Without you around

Rock,"I'm not worried about my life, it's too big.
Carpet stains on the ground and I think
I've found a way out downstairs turn around.
Wake me, take me up upside down.
Head down, lay down.
No one is ever around when I need them most.
Ricochet, right now.
I'm not worried about my life, it's too big.
Carpet stains on the ground and I thought I found a way out
Downstairs turn around.
Wake me, take me up upside down.
Hands down, lay down.
No one is ever around when I need them most.
Ricochet ricochet, right now

Pop,"Billy-Ray was a Preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
When they gathered round and started talking
Cousin Billy would take me walking
Through the back yard we'd go walking
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows to my suprise

Chorus:
The only boy who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
He was, yes he was, oh yes he was

Being good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I tried
When he started sweet talking to me
He'd come and tell me everything is alright
He'd kiss and tell me everything is alright
Can I get away again tonight

Chorus

How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealing kisses from me on the sly
Taking time to make time
Telling me that he's all mine
Learning from each others knowing
Looking to see how much we'd grown

The only boy who could ever move me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever groom me
Was the son of a preacher man
He was, yes he was, oh yes he was
"
Pop,"I could have been your June Carter Cash
Waltzed right along with you
All through this life with you
I could have been your light in the dark
The one that you're reaching for
When you can't take it anymore
We could have been
We could have been

Eighty years old sipping on history
Every drop, taste every memory
Under the stars, looking back on this beautiful love
that we made
Holding your hand

We could have had a big trampoline
Kids running ?round the yard
Superman and Barbie cars
We could have had that one of a kind love
The kind that fits like a glove
That everybody's jealous of
We could have been
We could have been

Eighty years old sipping on history
Every drop, taste every memory
Under the stars, looking back on this beautiful love
that we made
Holding your hand

Eighty years old sipping on history
Every drop, taste every memory
Under the stars, looking back on this beautiful love
that we made
Holding your hand"
Pop,"You in your fancy
Material world
Don't see the links of chain
Binding blood


Our own ancestors
Are hungry ghosts
Closets so full of bones
They won't close


Call it upward mobility
But you've been sold down the river
Just another form of slavery
And the whole man-made white world
Is your master


You in your fancy
Material world
Create in your own image
A supreme god


Your virgin mary
Your holy ghosts
Claimed to be pure of heart
Have hands that are stained with blood


You in your fancy
Material world
Don't see the links of chain
Binding"
Rock,"You've come up in the world
And it's all to your credit
You made something of your life
Like you always said you would
But whatever happened to the girl I used to know
And all those halcyon days of love

You've come up in the world
And it's such a shame
You made a success of a dream
But it seems so empty now
With your weak excuses and
Your condescending ways
And all to frequent nights alone

I've come down in the world
And it's all to your credit
You made something of my life
But you've thrown it all away
For your books and your fancy talk
Your new-found friends and all
Your theories on mankind and society"
Rock,"Hey, baby
That's alright people
I know that's alright
Oh, when we love each other
I know that's alright
Oh, feel it, feel it
Oh, everybody feel it
God knows that's alright, yeah
Some of us were born
With money to spend
Some of us were born
For races to win
Some of us are aware
That it's good for us to care
Some of us feel the icy wind
Of poverty blowing in the air
For those of us
Who simply like to socialize
For those of us who tend to the sick
Ah, and heed the people's cries
Let me say to you
Right on
Right on, feel it
Oh, Lord, Lord, people
And I say, right on
Honey right on
For those of us who live
Where peace is craved
For of us who live, uh huh
Where hatred is enslaved, alright
For those of us who live a life
Yea, surrounded by good fortune and wealth
Talk about it
Those of us who live a life
Hey, hey, hey, enjoying ourselves
For those of us who got drowned
In the sea of happiness
For the soul that takes pride
In his God
And himself and everything else
Love
That's all it is
We need love
That's all it is
Love, love
Love's the thing
Love, love, love, love
Sweet love, love
Wonderful love
Ah, true love, love
Love for your brother
Love for God
Pure love
Love can conquer hate everytime
Give out some love and you'll find
Peace sublime
And my darling, one more thing
If you let me, I will take you
To live where love is King
Ah, ah, baby, baby
People, people
People who love and care
That's alright
Alright
Ah............."
Pop,"Ninja? You're a ninja? Get out of here, you're a ninja!
Yes, I am a ninja

I read the rules before I broke 'em
I broke the chains before they choked me out
Now I pay close attention
Really learn the code
I learned to read the map before I hit the road

Hey yo, I know you never heard this before
But I'd rather lose a fight than miss the war
And I ain't wishing competition or fishin' for it
I'm just living in the system, conditions are poor
I've been lost in the rhythm and misinformed
Too many late nights hittin' the liquor store
Too many bad decisions, half assed attempts
No sweat, no fear, no blood, no tears
I go hard and I ain't makin' up no excuse
I'm overdue, I don't do what I'm supposed to do
Cause you can think about it man, we're supposed to lose
It ain't all picture perfect, ocean views
No, I was a first class rookie
Takin' out bullies in my all black hoodie
Man of mystery, you know the history
Get it or forget it, cause poof, I'm outta here

I read the rules before I broke 'em
I broke the chains before they choked me out
And I pay close attention
Really learn the code
I learned to read the map before I hit the road

(But we say)

Nobody's gonna see me comin'
Nobody's gonna hear a sound
No matter how hard they tryin'
No stoppin' me since I've found
My inner ninja

Hey yo, I've been high and I've been real low
I've been beaten and broken but I healed though
So many ups and downs, roughed up and clowned
We all got problems, but we deal though
I'm tryin' to do better now, find my inner peace
Learn my art form, and find my inner Chi
When my backs on the wall, I don't freeze up
Nah, I find my inner strength and I re-up
Here we go, I know I've never been the smartest or wisest
But I realize what it takes
Never dwell in the dark cause the sun always rises
But gotta make it to the next day
It's a feeling that you get in your lungs when you run
Like you're runnin' outta air and your breath won't come
And you (uh) wheezin', gotta keep it movin'
Find that extra (uhn) and push your way through it

I've had bad habits but I dropped em, I dropped em
I've had opponents but I knocked them out
I climbed the highest mountains
I swum the coldest seas
There ain't a thing I've faced that's been too much for me

(but we say)
Nobody's gonna see me comin'
Nobody's gonna hear a sound
No matter how hard they tryin'
Nobody's gonna bring me down

Nobody's gonna see me comin'
Nobody's gonna hear a sound
No matter how hard they tryin'
No stoppin' me since I've found
My inner ninja

I've had bad habits but I dropped em, I dropped em
I've had opponents but I knocked them out
I climbed the highest mountains
I swum the coldest seas
There ain't a thing I've faced that's been too much for me

Man, that was dope!
You think?
What're you, like, a third degree black belt?
Actually, I'm not even in karate but I've found... my inner ninja!"
Pop,"Konichiwa Records

It's gonna be OK
OK

Hey little star don't be afraid
We all fall apart and make mistakes

Don't you know nothing ever seem to make sense
You put your dancing shoes on and do it again
You know I believe it if you say you can

So when you feel like it's all pretend
Then you look into my eyes
Just say one true thing like you mean it
And, baby, just look into my eyes

Litte star

The sun's gonna shine on all of us
We're all the same - stardust and stuff
You're just a little boy and I'm just a little girl
Programmed rebels in a cruel, cruel world
We never get what we deserve

So when you feel like it's all pretend
Then you look into my eyes
Just say one true thing like you mean it
And, baby, just look into my eyes

And though I bet you think it's better on the inside
There with them
We're better off outside looking back in
I know you think you're lost but you think again
When you look into my eyes

OK

Hey little star
Come take my hand
You'll feel better tomorrow
Tomorrow I'm still your friend

So when you feel like it's all pretend
Then you look into my eyes
Just say one true thing like you mean it
And, baby, just look into my eyes
Ooh, you know I bet you think it's better on the inside
There with them
We're better off outside looking back in
I know you think you're lost but you think again
When you look into my eyes, Ok

Little star
I got you
I got you
You'll be OK
You'll be OK

Rock,"It’s an egg hunt for dates
On new roller-skates
While grooms and their brides
Take horse-drawn rides
Unless you’ve seen it
You cannot believe it
It’s so, so bizarre

Boys gone bad
With their absentee dads
Who live with their pets
‘Cause they’re hedgin’ their bets
Unless you’re seen it
You cannot believe it
It’s so, so bizarre

How can it be, that it’s only me
How can it be, that it’s only me

It’s a well-known song
And he’s singin’ it wrong
But the crowd’s on the bong
So they all clap along
Unless you’ve seen it
You cannot believe it
It’s so , so bizarre

It’s a summertime vibe
And the park is alive
And the actors arrive to be led on their lines
Unless you’re seen it
You cannot believe it
It’s so, so bizarre

How can it be, that it’s only me
How can it be, that it’s only me
That sees the strange
The strange, the strange"
Pop,"Can't fight this love

I've been hit by a train
It came out of the blue
What a beautiful pain
When I fell so hard for you
I just can't look away
When you walk in the room
There's no way to escape
There's only one thing I can do

Don't let it take control
There's no way I'll let you go
And the one thing that I know

Can't fight this love
Can't fight this energy
It's natural
It's taking over me
Can't fight this love
Flowing straight through my veins
Can't fight this love
Can't fight this, can't fight this
Can't fight this love

I don't know what it is
I'm down on my knees
I've been trying to resist
I can't take it anymore
It gets harder to breathe
Girl I'm hooked for sure
I can't hide what I feel
Cause you opened every door

Don't let it take control
There's no way I'll let you go
And the one thing that I know

Can't fight this love
Can't fight this energy
It's natural
It's taking over me
Can't fight this love
Flowing straight through my veins
Can't fight this love
Can't fight this, can't fight this
Can't fight this love

It took one look
And it was all over
One smile, and I was lost
You broke through my defenses
So I'm yours

Can't fight this love, yeah
Can't fight this love, oh
Can't fight this love, yeah yeah
Can't fight this love

Can't fight this love
Can't fight this energy

Pop,"There is fiction in the space between
The lines on your page of memories
Write it down but it doesn't mean
You're not just telling stories

There is fiction in the space between
You and reality
You will do and say anything
To make your everyday life seem less mundane
There is fiction in the space between
You and me

There's a science fiction in the space between
You and me
A fabrication of a grand scheme
Where I am the scary monster
I eat the city and as I leave the scene
In my spaceship I am laughing
In your remembrance of your bad dream
There's no one but you standing

Leave the pity and the blame
For the ones who do not speak
You write the words to get respect and compassion
And for posterity
You write the words and make believe
There is truth in the space between

There is fiction in the space between
You and everybody
Give us all what we need
Give us one more sad sordid story
But in the fiction of the space between
Sometimes a lie is the best thing
Sometimes a lie is the best thing"

To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love

I'm with you my love
The light's shinin' through on you
Yes, I'm with you my love

Never drive with a roach in the car,

He&acute;ll keep you waiting, if you&acute;ve got a date,
So you better relax &acute;cause you&acute;re gonna be late.

Flashin&acute;! Trashin&acute;! Crashin&acute;! It&acute;s The Man! It&acute;s The Man!

So we play the game, And it&acute;s always the same,
I&acute;ve got the power of the name,
I&acute;m gonna drive you insane.
Pull over to the right &acute;couse
you&acute;re gonna be wrong,
No matter what you got to say,
you better save it for a song.

Dedicated to The Man,

It&acute;s The Man!

Rock,"I tried to break away from you
From the spics and blacks and the gum you chew
Where the posters are torn by the muggin gangs
By the faggy parks and the burnt out vans

I've got 99 years of laying in the dark and I'm far too young to lie
I've got 99 ways to play my guitar it's going to pay me before I die

So bob your sweet head
Brother Ziggy going to play
I'm just about the best you can hear
Gonna rock it in your head
Shazam and come ball
With my guitar and Mr. Bang o
We can give you sweet head

I'm tough as glass and clean as night
Well if looks can love we can love all right
I'm your rubber peacock angelic whore
I'm a wrought iron face upon the wall

I had 99 days of murder come life and I'm running away from it all
I got a bedroom every mirror in town they're going to claim me if I fall

So bob your sweet head
Brother Ziggy going to play
I'm just about the best you can hear
Gonna rock it in your head
Shazam and come ball
With my guitar and Mr. Bang o
We can give you sweet head
Sweet head
Give you sweet head

While you down there

See my eyes of blocked emotion, see my tremble, see my fall
Traumatics thick and fast, your faith in me can last
Besides I'm known to lay you, one and all

Look south the way your mother dwells
If she knew what's going down, she'd give you hell
I'm the kind of man she warned me of
Till there was rock you only had god

You and I have a mutual vow we both like young, and we both like loud
I got pretty shoes and I'm kid and proud I'm street side out with my ear to the crowd

So bob your sweet head
Brother Ziggy going to play
I'm just about the best you can hear
It's gonna rock it in your head
Shazam and come ball
With my guitar and Mr. Bang o
We can give you a sweet head

Move along sir

"
Rock,"I’ve never see the sky like that
I can’t believe that it could do that
I closed my eyes before the sun could set
I slept and waited for my, waited for my…

I waited for my dreams to land
I waited for my dreams to touch down
I waited patiently to hear the sound
I waited for the song to get me out, to get me out of…

And I was up above
Watching myself crashing down
Yes I was up above
Watching myself crashing down

I’ve never seen so many lights
I’ve never heard so many voices
No one will tell me how I ended here
No one will tell me where, oh tell me where, oh tell me where I am
Where I am

And I was up above
Watching myself crashing down
Yes I was up above
Watching myself crashing down
Watching myself crashing down

Yes I was up above
Watching myself crashing down
There I was up above
Watching myself crashing down
Watching myself crashing down
Watching myself crashing down"
Rock,"I bless you madly, sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly, just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you that sets the test

So much has gone and little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter

I gave Them life
I gave Them all
They drained my very soul...dry
I crushed my heart to ease Their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can They spare
What of me?
Who praised Their efforts to be free?
Words of strength and care and sympathy
I opened doors that would have blocked Their way
I braved Their cause to guide, for little pay
I ravaged at my finance just for Those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me

I bless you madly, sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly, just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest, oh yes
Because it's you that sets the test

So much has gone and little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me,
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word

""We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers he had
Not of the best of men, but Ours
We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill Our needs
Now We are strong

And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in Our way
The silent guns of love will blast the sky

We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
Where money stood
We planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers
Sons of dirt

Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through Our sleeves
Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor on slogans such as

Wish You Could Hear
Love Is All We Need
Kick Out The Jams
Kick Out Your Mother
Cut Up Your Friend
Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End

And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above
And We Can Force You to Be Free
And We Can Force You to Believe

And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said

I believe in the Power of Good
I Believe in the State of Love
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right

And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain on the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich

And I Want to Believe
In the madness that calls now
And I want to Believe
That a light's shining through
Somehow

And I Want to Believe
And You Want to Believe
And We Want to Believe
And We Want to Live
Oh, We Want to Live

We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live

With this hand I've built, and with this I've burned
I wanna live in the same house, beneath the same roof
Sleep in the same bed, search for the same proof
As Leah

I got a life I wanna start, one I been waitin' to live
No more waitin', tonight I feel the light I say the prayer
I open the door, I climb the stairs..."
Rock,"Here’s another speech you wish I’d swallow
Another cue for you to fold your ears
Another train of thought too hard to follow
Chugging along to the song that belongs to the shifting of gears
Please forgive me for my distance
The pain is evident in my existence
Please forgive for my distance
The shame is manifest in my resistance
To your love, to your love, to your love
I would’ve warned you, but really, what’s the point?
Caution could but rarely ever helps
Don’t be down when my demeanor tends to disappoint
It’s hard enough even trying to be civil to myself
Please forgive me for my distance
The pain is evident in my existence
Please forgive for my distance
The shame is manifest in my resistance
To your love, to your love, to your love
My derring-do allows me to dance the rigadoon
Around you
But by the time I’m close to you, I lose
My desideratum and now you, so
Now you have it, so baby tell me what’s the word?
Am I your gal, or should I get out of town?
I just need to be reassured
Do you just deal it out, or can you deal with
What I lay down?
Please forgive me, for my distance
The pain is evident in my existence
Please forgive me for my distance
The shame is manifest in my resistance
To your love, to your love, to your love

I can't let it lay

Every night of the week
It's gonna be my fault,

If everything goes wrong
When I'm singing my song
It's gonna be my fault

There ain't nothing you can do about it
I've sat and thought it over,
Don't try to help me
I was just born this way,

So if everything goes wrong
And I drink all night
It's gonna be my fault

Don't hypnotize me

Banging hard upon her crooked drum
She feels them tearing down salvation
army houses back in Michigan
Her husband’s divorced but he treats her that way of course
Because he needs her just like he needs medicine
She forgets to write him anyway
She forgets to write him anyway
What’s red and white and nearly over

Pop,"I’ll just keep on fallin’ in love till I get it right
Right now I’m like a wounded bird hungry for the sky
But if I try my best and try long enough
I’m bound to learn to fly
So I’ll just keep on fallin’ in love till I get it right
My door to love has opened out more times than in

I’m either fool or wise enough to open it again
‘Cause I’ll never now what’s beyond the mountain
Till I reach the other side
So I’ll just keep on fallin’ in love till I get it right
If practice make perfect then I’m near about as perfect as I’ll
Ever be in my life
I’ll just keep on fallin’ in love till I get it right"
Rock,"Spread out now Rosie doctor come cut loose her mama's reins
You know playin' blind man's bluff is a little baby's game
You pick up Little Dynamite I'm gonna pick up Little Gun
And together we're gonna go out tonight and make that highway run
You don't have to call me lieutenant Rosie and I don't want to be your son
The only lover I'm ever gonna need's your soft sweet little girl's tongue and Rosie you're the one
Dynamite's in the belfry playin' with the bats
Little Gun's downtown in front of Woolworth's tryin' out his attitude on all the cats
Papa's on the corner waitin' for the bus
Mama she's home in the window waitin' up for us
She'll be there in that chair when they wrestle her upstairs `cause you know
we ain't gonna come
I ain't here for business, I'm only here for fun

Rosalita jump a little lighter, senorita come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover ain't no liar, Rosalita you're my stone desire

Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool skip some school act real cool Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
Rosie come out tonight, Rosie come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters chimneys for the poor
Closets are for hangers winners use the door

Rosalita jump a little...

Now I know your mama she don't like me `cause I play in a rock and roll band
And I know your daddy he don't dig me but he never did understand
Papa lowered the boom he locked you in your room
I'm comin' to lend a hand
I'm comin' to liberate you confiscate you I want to be your man
Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny
But now you're sad your mama's mad
And your papa says he knows that I don't have any money
Tell him this is last chance to get his daughter in a fine romance
Because a record company Rosie just gave me big advance

My tires were slashed and I almost crashed but the Lord had mercy
My machine she's a dud out stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
Hold on tight stay up all night `cause Rosie I'm comin' on strong
By the time we meet the morning light I will hold you in my arms
I know a pretty little place in Southern California down San Diego way
There's a little cafe where they play guitars all night and day
You can hear them in the back room strummin'
So hold tight baby `cause don't you know daddy's comin'

Rosalita jump a little...

Pop,"All right
Yeah
Grew up in a suburb that was right outside of sac town
Ridin in my brother's truck, music up too loud
Sittin on a sub face, clearin as we drive by
But it felt good, yeah, I'm not gonna lie
I can still feel it shake as I'm stuck in the back
In the middle of his friends while he drives too fast
I'm the only girl, I don't know how to act
But when I look back, I can't help but laugh

Laid back, cruisin like, hand out the window
Music always up, always up on the stereo
We don't even know, even know where we should go,
should go, should go

All those california kids listenin to country
Got a summer job, tryna make a little money
Livin our life, carefree like should be, should be, should be

Whoa oh

We do this every day
This is the way we
This is the way we
This is the way we live

Ooh ooh ooh
My life is like
Ooh ooh ooh
Uhh!

They turn that dirt lot into a teenage memory
Yeah, town centre was the friday night place to be
That was back when I was an el dorado hillian
Moved to malibu, now I'm hangin at pavilion

Norcal, socal, doesn't really matter
It's always a good time when we get together
Someone take a picture, remember this forever, ever, ever

Head down the boulevard, all the way to subway
Listen to the songs that we love, all my friends sing
Hey, you, I wanna know your name, your name, your name

Whoa oh
This is the way we live
We do this every day
This is the way we
This is the way we

Ooh ooh ooh

Pop,"A good fight half won
A good scotch half gone
And I'll never win Mr Congeniality
I bd's once again
She acquiesced
And I got off on a technicality

I've always loved our little wars
Treaties we sign behind closed doors
I may concede but I will not bleed
I will not bleed

The James Deam the prom queen
Impractical fascination
Having its way again
She knows Astaire's got nothing on me
When I take her out tonight
When I take her out tonight

I've always loved the way you dance
How you defy our circumstance
There may not be more than see
More than I see
C'est la vie

I know you well (You know me well)
I know you well (You know me well)
I know you well boy
And before the dawn comes you'll be gone

It's symbiotic
It's a sweet narcotic
Not a futile search for romantic perfection
That's too much trouble
So make mine a double
My head's a very scary neighborhood
Don´t wanna walk it alone

Thought I had something to day
Before you kissed my neck that way
I'll let it be
That works for me
So C'est la vie
C'est la vie

I know you well (You know me well)
I know you well (You know me well)
I know you well boy
And before the dawn comes you'll be gone

You know me well (I know you well)
You know me well (I know you well)
I know you well girl

Baby never leave, oh yeah
Even though it seems to me
Your love for me is true
I don't wanna ever be
The one you make a fool

Is this the real thing?
The once a love
My whole being
The one to give me everything
Is this the real thing?

Baby, why don't take this message as a sign
Coz everytime I see you boy
You're blowing my mind
Let me take you higher so we almost touch the sky
Tell me I'm the only one that sparkles in your eyes

The once a love
My whole being
The one to give me everything
Is this the real thing?

Is this the real thing?

Tell me I'm the only one that sparkles in your eyes

Is this the real thing?
The once a love
My whole being
The one to give me everything
Is this the real thing?
Cannot believe its happening
Will you be truly outstanding?

Rock,"We met upon a hill, the night was cool and still
She sucked my dormant will
Mother, she blew my brain, I will go back again
My God, she shook my cold

I had no time to spare, I grabbed her golden hair
And threw her to the ground
Father, she caved my head, Oh Lord, the things she said
My God, she should be told

I was very smart, broke the gentle hearts
Of many young virgins
I was quick on the ball, left them so lonely
They'd just give up trying
Then she took my head, smashed it up
Kept my young blood rising
Crushed me mercilessly, kept me going around
So she don't know I crave her so-o-o
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh

I'll give my love in vain, to reach that peak again
We met upon a hill
Mother, she blew my brain, I will go back again
"
Rock,"Baby, do you understand me now
Sometimes I feel a little mad
But don't you know that no one alive
Can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems that all I have do is worry
Then you're bound to see my other side
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
If I seem edgy I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has it's problems and I get my share
And that's one thing I never meant to do
Because I love you
Oh, Oh baby don't you know I'm human
Have thoughts like any other one
Sometimes I find myself long regretting
Some foolish thing some little simple thing I've done
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood"
Pop,"I'm so hypnotized, open the days, mesmerized
I'm tryina visualize you right now
Keep me cool right now
I like to be optimistic
You and me, that's futuristic
We can fly high like a spaceship
''Zoom'' right now, to the moon right now

You want me all alone
(Yeah, I heard that before)
But first I gotta know
(Gotta know if you insecure)
Can you take control?
(Tell me baby, can you break my lips?)
Boy, I gotta know
Wanna know if you're built for this
Built for this, built for this
I wanna know if you're built for this
I wanna know if you're built for this

Too fly for you, have to go
So cold like a popsicle
Row deep when we at the show
Guest list, Becky G plus Mexico
You don't know what you do to me
Got me acting all stupidly
And from my love I speak truthfully
In a world full of lies you're the truth to me

You want me all alone
Yeah, I heard that before
But first I gotta know
Gotta know if you insecure
Can you take control?
Tell me baby, can you break my lips?
Boy, I gotta know
Wanna know if you're built for this
Built for this, built for this

She bought just today to show

Every night there doing just the same
But they meet every Friday night under false names

So Mr and Mrs Smith come down
We got your room already for you have a wonderful time

She's got heart
She's got soul
But she's married to the banker man
Who only cares to dig for gold

And every night they're doing just the same
But they meet every friday night under false names

So Mr and Mrs Smith come down
We got your room already for you have a wonderful time

So Mr and Mrs Smith get a round
We got ya drinks all lined up for you in the bar, paint the town

Enjoy the luxury, the atmosphere
And every room got personality
Stay up all night, sleep all day
It's up to you, it's all okay
She likes to sing
She likes to dance
She says to him with every chance
Give me one more night
One more song, one more drink
Shake me all night long
All night long, all night long, all night long

He's got time, she's got taste
He brings the devil out of her
And puts a smile across her face

So Mr and Mrs Smith come down
Wr got your room already for you have a wonderful time
Enjoy the luxury, the atmosphere
And every room got personality
Stay up all night, sleep all day

One more drink, shake me all night long

Pop,"(Peter Lord / V. Jeffrey Smith / Sandra St. Victor)

Sitting, chilling, thinking about you babe
You're like a long, cool glass of lemonade
Bitter, sweet and I want you so bad it hurts
You complete my life
And you quench my thirst, sexy

Sexy feelings just come over me
Playing with my dress like a summer breeze
Gentle as the touch of a falling leaf
You open me up to love
Now I gotta believe, gotta believe

Bridge:
Nothing's too good for my baby
Anything you want be free
It's the least that I can do
What you've given me, given me

Chorus:
Cause I'm cool, crazy cool
Crazy cool with you
In this groove, crazy groove
Back act a fool
Hey I'm cool, crazy cool
You're crazy cool with me
In this groove, crazy cool
Everything you need, sexy

Laying in the grass
Writing poetry
Looking up at the midnight sun
When you're making love to me
You showed me just how cool
Crazy cool can be
Now I know the meaning of ecstasy, ecstasy

Rock,"There's some friends that I know living in this town and I've come far to see them
Gonna track em' down
They live in a brick house painted white and brown

Left a tip for the maid and I packed up my guitar, dropped my key on the counter, rented a car
Gonna hook up with em' later and go hit the bars

I need a big weekend
Kick up the dust
Yeah a big weekend
If you don't run, you rust

Well I may shake your hand but I won't know your name
The joke in your language don't come out the same
There's times when I'm down and there's nothing to blame

I need a big weekend
Kick up the dust
Yeah a big weekend
If you don't run, you rust

I can work, I can travel, sleep anywhere, cross every border with nothing to declare
You can look back babe, but it's best not to stare.

I need a big weekend
Kick up the dust
Yeah a big weekend
If you don't run, you rust."
Rock,"Tragic youth was looking young and sexy
The tragic youth was wearing tattered black jeans
Bearing arms and flaunting all her mischief
The tragic youth was going down on me

And I swear
Woo hoo
Yes I swear

I built a wall of sound to separate us
And hid among the junk of wretched highs
I sped from Planet X to Planet Alpha
Struggling for reality

Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo
Ha ha ha ha
Whoo hoo

Hey, now my sight is failing in this twilight
Da da da da da da da da da
Now my death is more than just a sad song
Da da da da da da da da da
And I swear
Woo hoo
Yes I swear
Woo hoo

I still don't remember how this happened
I still don't get the wherefores and the whys
I look for sense but I get next to nothing
Hey boy welcome to reality

Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo

I've been right and I've been wrong
Now I'm back where I started from
Never looked over reality's shoulder

Rock,"They say the hand is quicker than the eye
And two wrongs don't make a right

Time stops when I speak your name
Now and forever you are the one
Love-light shining on and on and on

Come on, yeh

Rock,"Now Brothers and Sister listen to me
These are the few things that I leave to thee
The Sword of our Fathers with lessons hard taught
The Shield strong and sturdy from battles well fought

This is your Sword, this is your Shield
This is the power of love revealed
Carry them with you wherever you go
And give all the love that you have in your Soul

At times there are dark, dark must cover the earth
This world? s filled with the beauty of God? s work
Hold tight to your brawn, stay righteous, stay strong
When the Days of miracles will come along

This is your Sword, this is your Shield
This is the Power of love revealed
Carry it with you wherever you go, wherever you go
And give all the Love that you have in your Soul

In the Days of despair you can grow hard
? til you close your Mind and empty your Heart
If you find yourself staring in the Abyss
Hold tight to your loved ones and remember this

This Shield will protect your secret Heart
The Sword will defend from what comes in the Dark
Should you grow weary on the Battlefield
Well do no despair, our love is real

This is your Sword, this is your Shield
This is the Power of love revealed
Carry it with you wherever you go, wherever you go
And give all the Love that you have in your Soul
And give all the Love that you have in your Soul"

Rock,"I took this walk to ease my mind
To find out what's gnawing at me
Wouldn't think to look at me,
that I've spent a lot of time in education
It all seems so long ago
I'm a thinker, not a talker
I've no-one to talk to, anyway

I can't see the road
for the rain in my eyes
Ahhh ...

I live above the grocers store,
owned by an Austrian
He often calls me down to eat
And he jokes about his broken English,
tries to be a friend to me
But for all my years of reading conversation,
I stand without a word to say

I can't see the bridge
for the rain in my eye
Ahhh...

And the world is full of life
Full of folk who don't know me
And they walk in twos or threes or mor
While the light that shines above the grocer's store
Investigates my face so rudely
And my essays lying scattered on the floor
Fulfill their needs just by being there
And my hands shake, my head hurts,
my voice sticks inside my throat
I'm invisible and dumb,
And no-one will recall me

And I can't see the water
through the tears in my ey-y-yes

Pop,"You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever needed, yeah

It's hard to make the things I did undone
A lesson I've learned too well, for sure
So don't hang up the phone now
I'm trying to figure out just what to do
I'm going crazy without you

You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever needed, yeah
So tell me what to do now
When I want you back

Baby I remember
The way you used to look at me and say
Promises never last forever
I told you not to worry
I said that everything would be all right
I didn't know then that you were right

Yeah
I want you back, oh yeah

See I don't chase girls, I erase girls
When they do me like that, be careful
Or you just another xo, xo, xo, xo, xo, xo, xo, xo

You pretend like you don't love me (love me)
Like you don't feel the same no more
Like it wouldn't even phase her to replace her
Like I'm nobody
Like I can get another date girl

See I don't chase girls, I erase girls
When they do me like that, now be careful

If the desert should fill with snow
If the earth should cease to spinnin'
There is somethin' I want you to know

Well the clouds may hide the mountains
And the rivers may run in the street
And the ones who were our heroes
May go down in bitter defeat

But I will never get tired of loving you
I will never get tired of loving you
I will never get tired of loving you
I will never get tired of loving you

Well I may have to surrender
Every dollar I ever earned
And I may wind up forgettin'
Every lesson I ever learned

If the devil climbs up to heaven
If the birds fall out of the sky
If the days get trapped in the nighttime
If we got no more tears to cry

But I will never get tired of loving you
I will never get tired of loving you
I will never get tired of loving you
I will never get tired of loving you

Well I saw you in a vision
And I chose you out of grace
By the light of your imagination
I saw the wonderment of your face

If you should lose all remembrance of me baby
And call me by another's name
If you should close your door and lock me out
I'm forever gonna feel the same

But I will never get tired of loving you
I will never get tired of loving you
I will never get tired of loving you
I will never get tired of loving you"
Rock,"Girl, have you ever been hungry
So hungry that you had no pride
Well, I got that feeling
That biting, gnawing deep inside

It's a funny pain
One I can't explain
You gotta help me, girl
Help me, girl
'Cause I'm going insane

I know about all the good things
And what that long green stuff can buy
Right or wrong, it's a groove, girl
Yet somehow I'm not satisfied
You gotta show me the way
Turn my night into day

You gotta help me, girl
Help me, girl
'Cause I'm going insane

Oh, I need someone
Someone to comfort me
Be my someone
Be my reality, girl

You gotta show me the way
And turn my night into day
Help me, girl
Help me, girl
'Cause I'm going insane

Oh, help me, girl
Help me, baby
Help me, girl
I need your love
I need your love so bad"
Rock,"Midway, this way of life we're bound upon
I woke to find myself in a dark wood,
Where the right road was wholly lost, and gone.

Aye me, how hard to speak of it,
That rude and rough and stubborn forest,
The mere breath of memory stirs the old fear in the blood.

But when, at last, I stood beneath a steep hillside,
Which closed that valley's wandering maze,
Whose dread had pierced me to the heart root deep.

Then I looked up, and saw the morning rays
Mantle its shoulder from that planet bright,
Which guides men's feet aright,
"
Rock,"

No, Medusa was not always a gorgon
No, my witch isn't always benevolent
She used me, an unwitting accomplice
On her weapon my fingerprints

How does this happen?
How does this happen?
How does this happen?

For twenty nine years
I've been searching for you
Twenty nine years
You, a most elusive truth
These tattered bits of me
I've been piecing
For twenty nine years

How does this happen?
How does this happen?
How does this happen?

So then, Athena wanted revenge
She let Poseidon get away with it
Just like my own witch almost did
Rock tied, ready to drown my marriage

How does this happen?
How does this happen?
How does this happen?

For twenty nine years
I've been searching for you
Twenty nine years
You, a most elusive truth
These tattered bits of me
I've been piecing
For twenty nine years

(How does this happen?)
Walk with me in your bare feet
In the sugar sand
Time to diffuse
Bombs I planted
In our bed
We can heal with forgiveness
In the sugar sand
My friend

For twenty nine years
I've been searching for you
Twenty nine years
You, a most elusive truth
These tattered bits of me
I've been piecing
For twenty nine years

These victim tears
A song from my past
To twenty nine years
Yes, we are free at last
We can unlash
Ourselves from that mast
After twenty nine years"
Pop,"I had not realized until now
How much I like you
How much makes me happy
To know that I will find you again
I still remember all the times
I wished I could just hug you
And I also remember all the times
When I imagined how we would become friends
I had no intention,
Of playing with your feelings
But you've to know that
If I had just one chance
I would not lose it

Chorus
It's amazing how you
suddenly appeared where I was
It's amazing how many
there were exchanges of glances between us
I know you could never
Fall in love for me
but you can confuse my mind
I thought you missed
what happened between us
but Irealized that I wasn't right
But you were the greatest thing to me

I love to realize
That you are looking for me
I still remember the days
When I sat on my bed and cried for you
But I can no longer go on with this illusion
It will be hard for me
'cuz I fell for you
but this is the right thing to do
I had no intention,
Of playing with your feelings
But you've to know that
If I had just one chance
I would not lose it

Chorus
It's amazing how you
suddenly appeared where I was
It's amazing how many

I know you could never
Fall in love for me
but you can confuse my mind
I thought you missed
what happened between us
but Irealized that I wasn't right
But you were the greatest thing to me

It's amazing how I
Always wanted you near me
It's amazing how I
Can't look into your eyes deeply
I know you could never
Fall in love for me
but you can confuse my mind
I thought you missed
what happened between us
but Irealized that I wasn't right
But you were the greatest thing to me"
Rock,"Lucille
You don't do your daddy's will

Pop,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows that turkey and some mistletoe
Can help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loading lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Rock,"I had a wife and kid, and I tried to settle down
I just wanted to live an honest life on the edge of an honest town.
But in the end they left me danglin' danglin (in the night?)
and I went crazy tryin', tryin' to walk that thin line.

Oh Chevrolet Deluxe, I bought you with all your accessories,
Oh Chevrolet Deluxe, I bought you with all your accessories,
but mister, I can't keep my payments up
I lie awake at night and wonder if I'm tough enough
to win back the hand of Chevrolet Deluxe.
......
They shut the power off down at the mill (the count the third time?)
and these days when you ride down Main Street
it's just whitewashed windows and vacancy signs
Did you ever think til the end your kids you would never believe
that if you would leave this old town, that it would leave me.

My brother's down in Ft Bragg, been there for half a year
man he just got into too much trouble around here.

Chevrolet Deluxe, I bought her with all the accessories,
but mister, I can't keep those payments up
Chevrolet Deluxe, I lost my heart, I lost my guts....
......
She was sittin' down at Highway Chevrolet out on Route 3
She was lookin'g like she was waitin' just for me
I worked all summer long and I saved my money up
And I went down and I put that money down

In the fall, Billy, (...?)
I drove him down rode down together down to Fort Bragg
In the years that he was gone (...?)
(...?) in the refinery (...?) go along

Chevrolet Deluxe, I bought her with all the accessories,
(...?)
Another year end gone, and Billy he came home
(...?)

But it was like all of a sudden there was a curse
Things got band and things got worse
Hmmm... went the power there down at the mill
Hmmm... the thrill when they shut the power down at the mill
(...?)

Chevrolet Deluxe, I bought her with all the accessories,
But I can't keep those payments up
Chevrolet Deluxe

(...?) you were so clear to see
Now when I wake in the mornging I don't know what's happening to me

Chevrolet Deluxe, I bought her with all the accessories,
Mister I can't keep those payments up
Chevrolet Deluxe you let me down took the heart right out of me

I saw her when I was 17 down at Hansen's Chevrolet
I made up my mind to get her any how, any way.
That whole summer I worked until I had enough
Then I went and put my money down on that Chevrolet Deluxe.

[...]
Chevrolet Deluxe, I bought her with all the accessories,
but mister, I can't keep those payments up
Chevrolet Deluxe, I lost my heart, she took my gut...

It don't matter what you want, it don't matter what you say,
Are you tough enough not to play the way they play.
"
Rock,"Dreams
Had more than a few
Dreams
And some did come true

We just can’t get enough

Now we’ve got all we wanted
Still we’re not satisfied at all
If it can’t be found
You’ll never get it
If it can’t be found
If it can’t be found

Greed
What can we do
Greed
Can’t satisfy you

We just can’t get enough

Now we’ve got all we wanted
Still we’re not satisfied at all
If it can’t be found
You’ll never get it
If it can’t be found
If it can’t be found"
Rock,"Strum me hard, strum me fast,
Fears sure built into every wall.
Looking hard through the glass,
Fears sure built in with every waltz.

Looking out at the rain
Looking in through the storm.
Treading the waves,
Come in from harm.
How could you regret your other words ...
Hoping for thrills â€” free as a bird ...

Strum me hard, strum me fast,
Fears sure built into every wall.
Looking hard through the glass,
Fears sure built in with every waltz.

There's a knock at the door,
I get up â€” let you in.
Travelled and stained,
Soaked to the skin.
Welcome my darling, you got here at last ...
Come and sit by the fire â€” forget what's past.

So sad, so sad,
So sad, so sad.

Strum me hard, strum me fast,
Fears sure built into every wall.
Looking hard through the glass,
Fears sure built in with every waltz.

Looking out at the rain
Looking in through the storm.
Looking back, looking forward,
Flying up, flying down â€”
What have you found ?

So sad, so sad
What have you found ?
So sad, so sad
What have you found ?
So sad, so sad
What have you found ?
"
Rock,"Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're tryin' to be so quiet ?
We sit here stranded, though we're all doin' our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin' you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.

Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, ""Jeeze
I can't find my knees""
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.

The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him
Sayin', ""Name me someone who's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him""
But like Louise always says
""Ya can't look at much, can ya man ?""
As she, herself, prepares for him
And Madonna, she still hasn't showed
We see the empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps on the road
He writes ev'rything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish trucks that load
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
"
Rock,"You can tell me the world is round and I'll prove to you it's square
You can keep your feet on the ground,
but I'll be walking on air
You're pretty good at waiting
While I go running around
Well, that's just the way it is, you know
I got a hole in my pocket
You give me love and I drop it
I guess I threw it away
We stick together with every day that passes by
But I'm just like the weather, I keep on changing my mind
Well you can hardly believe it
Every time I turn and say, well
Good morning, I'm leaving
And I'll be back in a few days
But that's just the way it is, you know o

[CHORUS:]
I got a hole in my pocket
You give me love and I drop it
I guess I'll throw it away
I got a four leaf clover
I'll throw it over my shoulder
I'm gonna need it someday o

When things don't go right you lead me
Torn up and tied---you free me
When life is strange you take me
Through every change, you never break me
You got a feeling there's a wall that you can never climb
I try to be there where you are, I try to be on time
But I lose my way

[CHORUS]
"
Rock,"Hey kid I've got a ride for you
They say your brain is a comic book tattoo
and you'll never be anything
What will you do with your life
Oh thats all you hear from noon till night

Take a trip on a rocket ship baby
The sea is the sky
I know the guy who runs the place and he's out of sight
Flying Dutchman
Are you out there Flying Dutchman

Straight suits they don't understand
She tried that one with the alligator boots
but the other side drew her in
Heart falling fast when she left
Even the milky way was dressed in black

Take a trip on a rocket ship baby
The sea is the sky
I know the guy who runs the place and he's out of sight
Flying Dutchman
Are you out there Flying Dutchma

Cuz they can't see what you're born to be
They can't see me
They can't be what they can't believe
They can't see what you see

Keep the boys spinning in their own little world
Tie them up so they won't say a word
Keep the boys spinning in their own little world
So afraid you'll be what they never were

Take a trip on a rocket ship baby
The sea is the sky
I know the guy who runs the place and he's out of sight
Flying Dutchman
Are you out there Flying Dutchman

Cuz they can't see...

Pop,"I have boyfriend
He says I'm his only one
We wanna get married
But we're so young

So young
Can't marry no one
No one

Just a teenage affection
But no one knows
My heart's direction

So young
Can't marry no one
No one
Ooo...

I'm, I'm, I'm, so young
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so young
I'm, I'm, I'm, so young
Can't marry no one

Gotta go now
Cry myself to sleep
My lovin' baby
Will have seen the last of me

Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one"
Pop,"Oh, Holy Night
The stars
Are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear
Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin
And error pining
'Til He appeared
And the soul felt
It's worth a thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new
And glorious morn
Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices

Oh, night divine
Oh, night
When Christ was born
Oh, night divine
Oh night
Oh, Holy night
Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh, night divine
Oh, night
When Christ was born
Oh, night divine
Oh, night
Oh, Holy night"
Rock,"Woke up this morning my house was cold
Checked out the furnace she wasn't burnin'
Went out and hoped in my old Ford
Hit the engine but she ain't turnin'
We've given each other some hard lessons lately
But we ain't learnin'
We're the same sad story that's a fact
One step up and two steps back

Bird on a wire outside my motel room
But he ain't singin'
Girl in white outside a church in June
But the church bells they ain't ringing
I'm sitting here in this bar tonight
But all I'm thinkin' is
I'm the same old story same old act
One step up and two steps back

It's the same thing night on night
Who's wrong baby who's right
Another fight and I slam the door on
Another battle in our dirty little war
When I look at myself I don't see
The man I wanted to be
Somewhere along the line I slipped off track
I'm caught movin' one step up and two steps back

There's a girl across the bar
I get the message she's sending
Mmm she ain't lookin' to married
And me well honey I'm pretending
Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms
The music was never-ending
We danced as the evening sky faded to black
One step up and two steps back"
Rock,"She was born in November 1963
The day Aldous Huxley died
And her mama believed
That every man could be free
So her mama got high, high, high
And her daddy marched on Birmingham
Singing mighty protest songs
And he pictured all the places
What he knew that she belonged
But he failed and taught her young
The only thing she needs to carry on
He taught her how to

Run baby run baby run baby run
Baby run

Past the arms of the familiar
And their talk of better days
To the comfort of the strangers
Slipping out before they say
so long
Baby loves to run

She counts out all her money
In the taxi on the way to meet her plane
Stares hopeful out the window
At the workers fighting
Through the pouring rain
She's searching through the stations
For an unfamiliar song
And she's pictures all the places
Where she knows she still belongs
And she smiles the secret smile
Because she knows exactly how
To carry on

So run baby run baby run baby run
Baby run

From the old familiar faces and
Their old familiar ways
To the comfort of the strangers
Slipping out before they say
So long
Baby loves to run"
Rock,"All over the world the rain was pourin'
I was scratchin' where it itched
Oh heartbreak and despair got nothing but boring
So I grabbed you baby like a wild pitch

It takes a leap of faith to get things going
It takes a leap of faith you gotta show some guts
It takes a leap of faith to get things going
In your heart you must trust

Now your legs were heaven your breasts were the altar
Your body was the holy land
You shouted ""jump"" but my heart faltered
You laughed and said ""Baby don't you understand?""

It takes a leap of faith to get things going
It takes a leap of faith you gotta show some guts
It takes a leap of faith to get things going
In your heart you must trust

Now you were the Red Sea I was Moses
I kissed you and slipped into a bed of roses
The waters parted and love rushed inside
I was Jesus' son sanctified

Tonight the moon's looking young but I'm feelin' younger
'Neath a veil of dreams sweet blessings rain
Honey I can feel the first breeze of summer
And in your love I'm born again

It takes a leap of faith to get things going
It takes a leap of faith you gotta show some guts
It takes a leap of faith to get things going
In your heart you must trust

Rock,"I stood close enough to hear you say
""Do as the beautiful once did""
Tore out my picture from its frame
I just wanted to be one of you

Standing on the outside
Lookin'
Lookin'
Funny how you see the truth
But the feeling does come back
To you

She's crazy as anyone can be
That's what they say
They say of me
Wanting love can make one do
Isn't my fault
Heredity

Standing on the outside
Lookin'
Lookin'
State of grace
State of sin
Standing on the outside
Lookin'
Lookin'
I cannot feel a single thing
But the feeling does come back
Again

This morning feels like yesterday
Yesterday follows me around
Where do you go where no one cares
Six feet under
Underground

Standing on the outside
Lookin'
Lookin'
State of grace
State of sin
Standing on the outside
Lookin'
Lookin'
I cannot feel a single thing
But the feeling will come back
Again - again

You picked me up when I was living
down in Egypt
Led me out and opened up the door
When you showed me just how much you
thought my heart ment
But I turned and walked away into
the wilderness
Now who would have guessed

I hear you calling my name for a reunion
I hear you calling my name for a reunion
I thought I'd wandered too far away
But now I've got a brand new start
Reunion, reunion of the heart

Now I'm standing n the edge of the land
I want to go out and take all that you gave me
But I'm frightened and you understand
I failed you last time and I don't want a repeat
Still when I'm quiet again I shelter from the noise
I just hear your voice

I hear you calling my name for a reunion
I hear you calling my name for a reunion
I thought I'd wandered too far away

Wo-oh, let's party
Yeah, let's party, and have a good time

There go the paparazzi
I really don't give a f*ck, who got in my way

Good times are here, and you know they're here to stay
If you're not here to party, move and get out of the way

I'm f*cked up, I can't tell you what's what
All she know is how to f*ck
I walked up to a big butt, and ask her ass 'bout what
Tunechi never slacks without a button up
I roll the dice and love up
I'm all in, I'm all in
More money more problems, more money what's old then
It's YMCMB b*tch

I get special treatment
Girl turn over, good defense

We turned down for what
Tomorrow isn't promised
Tonight is all we got
And times like these are timeless

Love is such a science, do you think it's love?
Thanks for not replying
It's Paris Hilton, b*tch

Rock,"Whatever it is you know you think you want
Well here's a little something to light the way
Inside your heart where the darkness stays
I believe the sun still rises here but when it falls
I'm not sure what there is to say
Flickers in my night like a memory

I am not rocks
I am not rain
I'm just another shadow in the stream
That's been washed away after all these years
I am not rocks in the river
I am bursting in tears for it

And the day is dawning

Whatever it is you wanted I think you got
But take a little something to light the way
Inside your mind when the weather is gray
I believe the sun still rises here but when it falls
There is something to be said for the calm at night
When the stars up above are so cold and bright

And I am not rocks
I am not rain
I'm just another shadow in the stream
That's been washed away after all these years
I am not rocks in the river
I am bursting in tears for it

And the day is dawning
And the day is dawning"
Rock,"Hey let's party
Let's get down
Let's turn the radio on
This is the meltdown
Get out the camera
Take a picture
The drag queens and the freaks
Are all out on the town
And cowboy Jane's in bed
Nursing a swollen head

[Chorus]
Sunshine Sally and Peter Ustanov
Don't like the scene any how
I dropped acid on a Saturday night
Just to see what the fuss was about
Now there goes the neighborhood

The photo chick made to look sickly
Is standing in her panties in the shower
She plays the guitar in the bathroom
While the police dust her mother's plastic flowers
And Schoolboy John's in jail
Making a killing through the U.S. mail

[Chorus]

This is the movie of the screenplay
Of the book about a girl who meets a junkie.
The messenger gets shot down
Just for carrying the message to a flunkie.
We can't be certain who the villans are 'cuz everyone's so pretty
But the afterparty's sure to be a wing-ding as it moves into your
city

There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood

Rock,"Two kids get married, same old thing
Folks congratulate you, church bells ring
Who's got the ring, who's gonna pay the priest
Get your name in the paper, picture or two at least

And at the reception all the old records play
""Where you gonna live, are you gonna take her away?""
In a corner my new nephew's showin' me his knife
You swore that you'd love her for the rest of your life

Went to kiss you at the altar we bumped heads
Honeymoon night we figured we best shake on it instead
Dressed kinda funny, laughin' we hop in bed
You can wear it on your feet, you can wear it on your head

Come mornin' my new family's sitting on the front porch swing
Smilin' kinda funny, nobody says a thing
My new brother-in-law's throwin' a football, he tosses me a pass
We all sit down on the front stoop, everybody happy at last
"
Rock,"I stood in the warmth of the light
Chilled to the bone
Hundreds of faces in sight
Still I was alone

Door after door
And room after empty room
I've stood here before
But under a different moon

In the longest days and the darkest nights
Down the longest road there's a presence of light
I hear a voice that calls me
It's love's name I call
In the end

I've walked in and out of the fire
Between truth and lies
Now how many children watch
While one child crys

I'll tear down these walls
And watch while their souls are freed
I'll throw away pride
To drown in this endless sea

In the longest days and the darkest nights
Down the longest road there's a presence of light
I hear a voice that calls me
It's love's name I call
In the end

Hundreds of tears on the water
Mercy come rain down on me

In the longest days and the darkest nights
Down the longest road there's a presence of light
In the longest days and the darkest nights
Down the longest road there's a presence of light
I hear a voice that calls me
It's love's name I call
In the end

Hundreds of tears on the water
Mercy come rain down on me
Hundreds of tears on the water
Mercy come rain down on me
Hundreds of tears on the water
Mercy come rain down on me
Hundreds of tears on the water
Mercy come rain down on me

Rock,"Long distance information, give me Memphis Tennessee
Help me find the party trying to get in touch with me
She did not leave her number but I know the place to call
The phone boy took the message and he wrote it on the wall

I said help me information get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here from Memphis Tennessee
Her home is on the south side, high up on a ridge
About a half a mile from the Mississipi bridge

Oh help me information, more than this I cannot add
Only that I love Marie and all the fun we had
But we were pulled apart now 'cause her momma did not agree
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee

I said help me information, more than this I cannot add
Only that I miss Marie and all the fun we had
But she was pulled apart from me 'cause her momma did not agree
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee

Last time I saw Marie, she was waving me goodbye
With hurry home drops on her cheek that trickl'd from her eye
Marie is only six years old, so information please
Try to put me through to her in Memphis Tennessee
I said try to put me through to her in Memphis Tennessee
Oh won't you put me through to her in Memphis Tennessee
"
Rock,"When I pick up my guitar
This is the song that always comes
Don't know what I'm singing 'bout and
Don't know what for
I think about you
And I think about Rosebud

Wish there was a song to sing
To bring you back
But you can't get here from nowhere I guess
Rosebud's shipwrecked up on the Ohio
Behind a wall of glass
Telling me to take care of myself
And my friends

You sing to a field of trees
And roses singing those melodies
Simple and easy where everything moves
Underneath you
And Rosebud too

I wish there was a song to sing
To get you back
But you can't get here from nowhere I guess
Rosebud's shipwrecked up on the Ohio
Behind a wall of glass
Telling me to take it easy
But I took a photograph
And she's just a wooden machine
But you and Rosebud, you're still singing to me"
Pop,"Cold hearted in an empty bed
Broken pieces
And I know I lost my head
But I lied when I said
That I could have lived without you
Cause I can't live without you

If you could see me now from the inside out
You'd see the wreckage
Of a man trying to find a way out
I couldn't love you more
Love you more
Love you more

Cause I made my mistakes
And you can walk away
You know that ain't nobody gonna love you more
Ain't nobody gonna love you more

Heartbreak and the time it takes
From true love to too late
Oh man, what a mess I've made
Well, I dug my own grave
But I won't live without you
No, I won't live without you

If you could see me now from the inside out
You'd see the wreckage
Of a man trying to find a way out
I couldn't love you more
Love you more
Love you more

Cause I made my mistakes
And you can walk away
You know that ain't nobody gonna love you more
Ain't nobody gonna love you more

So put your keys away
Cause you're not thinking straight
You know that ain't nobody gonna love you more
Ain't nobody gonna love you more
Oh yeah
You know that ain't nobody gonna love you more
Ain't nobody gonna love you more

Cause I made my mistakes
And you can walk away
But ain't nobody gonna love you more
Ain't nobody gonna love you more"
Pop,"Dani
If i were a boy even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what i wanted
And go drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who i wanted
And i'd never get confronted for it
'cause they stick up for me

Lisa
If i were a boy
I think i could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear i'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'cause i know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'cause he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

Dani
If i were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that i was sleeping alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as i go
'cause i know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home, to come home

Lisa
If i were a boy
I think i could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear i'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'cause i know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'cause he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think i'd forgive you like that
If you thought i would wait for you
You thought wrong

Dani
But you're just a boy
You don't understand

Lisa
And you don't understand, oh
How it feels to love a girl
Someday you wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'cause you're taking her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

Dani
But you're just a boy"

A good place to start
There’s that end
That’s the beginning of it all
Are you that girl
That’s going to break my heart
I don’t wanna be me
When disappointment makes its call

All I know is that…

If you don’t know by now
All my hope it gone

You must know
Know what you want
And if you go
It don’t matter who is at fault
Now I see
I’m up against the wall
Don’t wanna be me
When disappointment makes its call

All I know is that…

If you don’t know by now
All my hope is gone

Oh yea…it’s so hard to say
Seems to be this day
Seems to be that way
I don’t know what to tell you

Give in this time and show me some affection
We're going for those pleasures in the night

I want to love you, feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow, I'll let it go

I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I want you

We shouldn't even think about tomorrow
Sweet memories will last a long long time
We'll have a good time baby don't you worry
And if we're still playing around boy that's just fine

Let's get excited, we just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it

It knows me all too well
It's begging for a party
And I ain't going by myself

Awww, don't just sit there
Say yes and make it fast
Don't tell me you don't wanna
Make some footprints in the grass

Pick it up, pick it up
Dance around 'til the sun goes down
Find somebody and fall in love
Close your eyes and spin around
Sing it out, shout it out
Tell the moon that you ain't done with that
Freer than you've ever been
Mandolin summer sun

It sounds like innocence
It sounds like letting go
Sounds like you've got it made
And not afraid to let it show

Get out your wild and reckless
Get out your two left feet
A little side of crazy
Yeah, yeah that's all you need

Pick it up, pick it up
Dance around 'til the sun goes down
Find somebody and fall in love
Close your eyes and spin around
Sing it out, shout it out
Tell the moon that you ain't done with that
Freer than you've ever been
Mandolin summer sun

Pick it up, pick it up
Dance around 'til the sun goes down
Find somebody and fall in love
Close your eyes and spin around

Pick it up, pick it up
Dance around 'til the sun goes down
Find somebody and fall in love
Close your eyes and spin around
Sing it out, shout it out
Tell the moon that you ain't done with that
Freer than you've ever been
Throwin' caution to the wind
Prayin' that it never ends
Mandolin summer sun

Come on now, come on now,
Get out your two left feet

Come on now, come on now,
Yeah, yeah that's all you need

Pick it up, pick it up
Dance around 'til the sun goes down

Pick it up, pick it up
Close your eyes and spin around"

Rock,"You know, man, when I was a young man in high school
you believe in or not I wanted to play football for the coach
And all those older guys
they said he was mean and cruel, but you know
wanted to play football for the coach
They said I was to little too light weight to play line-backer
so I say I'm playing right-end
wanted to play football for the coach
'Cause, you know some day, man
you gotta stand up straight unless you're gonna fall
then you're gone to die
And the straightest dude
I ever knew was standing right for me all the time
So I had to play football for the coach
and I wanted to play football for the coach

When you're all alone and lonely
in your midnight hour
And you find that your soul
it's been up for sale

And you begin to think 'bout
all the things that you've done
And you begin to hate
just 'bout everything

But remember the princess who lived on the hill
Who loved you even though she knew you was wrong
And right now she just might come shining through
and the -

- Glory of love, glory of love
glory of love, just might come through

And all your two-bit friends
have gone and ripped you off
They're talking behind your back saying, man
you're never going to be no human being
And you start thinking again
'bout all those things that you've done
And who it was and what it was
and all the different things you made every different scene

Ahhh, but remember that the city is a funny place
Something like a circus or a sewer
And just remember different people have peculiar tastes
and the -

- Glory of love, the glory of love
the glory of love, might see you through
yeah, but now, now
Glory of love, the glory of love
the glory of love, might see you through
Glory of love, ah, huh, huh, the glory of love
Glory of love, glory of love
Glory of love, now, glory of love, now
Glory of love, now, now, now, glory of love
Glory of love, give it to me now, glory of love see you through

Rock,"Aimless lady, is this your home town?
Tell me baby, tell me where you're bound.
When our eyes met, you were in the very first row.
I couldn't even guess your name, but I just had to know.


You were meant for me, would you grab your coat and flee?
You were a mystery, but you just had to be ...
An aimless lady.
Aimless lady.
Aimless lady.


Should I try, and satisfy, you lady?
Ain't no lie, now we'll get by, my baby.
If you can stand, a real good man, now lady,
Take my hand, and understand, me baby.


Take your time, you're doing fine, now lady.
You got yours, and I got mine, now baby.
Can you see, the way to be, now lady.
Stay with me, and set me free, now baby.


Aimless lady.

You're mine aimless lady.

You're mine aimless lady.

Pop,"Frankly my dear I don’t give a damn
I wish that’s how I felt
I just can’t hide the fool that I am
As I let you walk away

Into the sunset
I was just another fine mess
I tried to do the right thing
Ended up with nothing good
I blame Hollywood

I tried to be strong, to be brave, to behave like a hero
I tried to be tough, to be cool, to be smooth like De-Niro
But it hurts without you
And I look like a fool
And I don’t have a clue what to say when love breaks down
Cos this aint tinsel town

I made a mistake and I got confused
It’s easy to forget
That this is real life, with so much to lose
When I let you walk away

Into the sunset
I wasn’t broken-hearted
There’d be a happy ending
But I ended up with nothing good
I blame Hollywood

I fell for the lines
You knew that I would
Hooray for Hollywood"
Rock,"She got high class,
She rides around in a cut down Chevy machine.
Her eyes are plate glass,
Oh and legs like a limousine.
She comes stocked with sass,
And pride ain't there to be mean.
She's the baddest thing this town's ever seen.
Oh, Street Queen.

Well, she got a turbine engine, mama,
With maximum thrust.
Cadillac hips, she's got the best on the strip,
She knows how to use a clutch.
She comes on shiny and black,
And, boys, if you hit her you better be tough.
Oh she's the slickest thing that I've ever seen.
Oh, Street Queen.

And you can always tell a moment she's around,
You can hear the loud engine roaring.
She says, ""Come on, get in. Hey baby, you want to go for a ride?""
I know she sets your mind soaring.
Oh and the boys, they jump back,
As that engine unwinds.
I'm glued to my seat, mama,
As I watch that speed-o-meter climb.
Oh she moves so fast she's almost obscene.
Street Queen.

Well, if you're going to come streakin' down my street, baby,
Like an angel with them Chevy Wings.
If you're going to come streakin' down my street, baby,
Like an angel with them Chevy Wings.
You better watch out, Street Queen,
Cause you're messing with the king.
"
Rock,"How come you don't realise the shape you're in
Sweatin' over lies to justify the naked sin within
A spineless irritation from some time before
When more than life was cursin' through my veins.

You made me and you slayed me and you tortured me
Laughing as you lay upon our bed of bloody love â€” and left me.
Think about me, drink about me, I don't care,
'Cause now I realise the shape I'm in.

If I was alive, I'd open up the gates for you,
If I'd only cried aloud, I'd still be here.
In my other life, I'm making plans for you, my dear,
So come on babe, your time is drawing near.

Across the street they're eating now and holding hands,
An image of a priest with bibles lain across his hands for me.
Don't think about me, drink about me, I don't care,
'Cause now I realise the shape I'm in.

If I was alive, I'd open up the gates for you,
If I'd only cried aloud, I'd still be here.
In my other life, I'm making plans for you, my dear,
So come on babe, your time is drawing near.

In the house, my mother's house, the clocks have all stood still,
An empty picture frame upon a dirty window sill .
In the yard, my father's yard, a tombstone breaks in two,
Shattered by a lying snake like you.
"
Rock,"I walked the heat of seven hills
Endless talk of losing wills
Great highways in a constant melt
Men and women and children all have overbuilt

Buying bread and paying for none
Creatures of a waning sun
Teacher's hands are overrun
Clowns and gypsies have all but gone

You make me wanna
Shine over Babylon
You make me wanna
Shine over Babylon

Freedoms etched on Sacred pillars
Hollow stones of mindless filler
Can lead to madman oil drillers
Won't be long before we all are killers

Little boy lost way up the mountains
Cities drowning under boiling fountains
I dreamed of chilly, sunlit days
I was trembling in a golden haze

You make me wanna
Shine over Babylon
You make me wanna
Shine over Babylon

Celebrate the golden cow
Praise the bloated bank account
If there's a god where is he now
The precipice is slipping further out

Sanskrit message from the mounts
Leave your possession, hope abounds
There's nothing here for you to cry about
We're all just followers from here on out

I take the stage, I walk the planks
I sing these songs with little thanks
I wait for shouts from crazy cranks
I stand amidst the brown shirt ranks

I found my way to alexandria
Where gurus bubble up on gangea
Scavengers, they run up and hand ya
All the junk that should have damned ya

You make me wanna
Shine over Babylon
You make me wanna
Shine over Babylon

If everything in life was free
You'd float in your own reverie
The things that you could never see
Seal the gap between you and me

You make me wanna
Shine over Babylon
You make me wanna
Shine over Babylon"

At his head a stone.

Pop,"Before we say goodnight
Look down and call for time
Before we walk away, just think
I wish that I could say, this heart will never break
Before we start again, lets think

We felt too much to fall
Don't bow when the curtain falls
Before we lose it all, before we lose it all

If it's not hard enough, if it don't hurt enough
If it's not hard to find, if it don't change your life
Then it's not love

It's never how you plan
And when you've lost all hope
That's when you'll understand
Maybe it's my mistake
I say too much too late
'Til we communicate, again

Don't hide when the rain falls
If it's easy then it can't be loved
Before we lose it all, before we lose it all

If it's not hard enough, if it don't hurt enough
If it's not hard to find, if it don't change your life
Then it's not love

Not love
'Cos love is never planned
Not for us to understand
'Cos love, yes love
Is all we really have

If it's not hard enough, if it don't hurt enough
If it's not hard to find, if it don't change your life
Then it's not love

It is not hard to find
Then it's not love
Then it's not love
Then it's not love
Everywhere you know
Then it's not love"

Outside the big engine roared and rumbled
The stolen horse spooked and tumbled
She didn't speak for a week
Just kinda mumbled

ankle deep in love (x4)

He was caught up in a lie he half believed
Found her hiding high in the family tree
Washed his hands and put her cross his knee
She said daddy ""you been a mother to me""

Ankle deep in love (x4)"
Rock,"I remember yesterday and I'd sit and watch the hound dogs play
Howlin' at the China moon
??Now yesterday is the busted blues
Life was young, things were easy,
Days were short, nights were warm
Time were good. Hate was shallow
??The horse crazy behind the ????
I swear that I've seen your face somewhere back in that time
and I'm in theat place. Do you remember?
The old house stood like World War Two with just rooms
and a hall to be used.
The lady was mean.
Just slightly unclean with a heart of cold silver and gold.
Kitchen smelled of kerosene.
Celing hung down on ?veil? and rotted beams
and the man, they said, his work could of hung in the room
Now he sits around all day because his left arm won't move
He was a master of the art of electricity
He lectured on tours and circuitry.
He was self-employed, but he could never see his way into the light
He had a room full of switches and dials and lights and
a head full of clouds and eyes full of sight.
And when it got dark,
I could hear his heartbeat like a mother in the night.
She stood like a guardian ready to give everything up.
If I had asked for a sword and her blood in a cup.
but there was just time when I asked for too much.
She sighed because she could not give it.
We used to sit beneath the tree just the lady, the radio man and me.
And I think it was the winter of '63 the man went away and let us be
It was early on an August day that the lady decided she must go away.
Her heart it seems could not pay the price for what her body was buying
I came home from school and I found the note went into the kitcken
and lit the old stone with songs set on overload.
I turned on the TV, spent the rest of the sfternoon watching
all my cartoons thru the hall
and across the porch was the sun surrendered like a crying torch.
"
Rock,"All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the waste-land
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise,
right between the ey..es

Seemed a good idea
to drop a bomb on the waste-land, yeah
Only one man could be seen,
and he was old and so serene
Captain sat in his deck chair,
and the red light flashed ""beware""
Pilot felt quite big-time
as the bomb sailed through the air
Well, they danced and sang
when the bang went bang
When the lights popped out
and the smoke began to clear,
it was positively queer!

""Die"" said the General,
""cobblers"" said the man
So the Pentagon sent a cable,
and the Queen a telegram
A-bombs, H-bombs, even very small ones
ripped apart that sand
'Til the stench was just revolting!,
and the sky a green-ish tan
But the soldier said ""Sir,
there's a crack in the world""
And the figures went ""squash"",
and the bits flew far and wide
How the universe sighed!

When the smoke had blown away,
there was nothing left to view
Except a man, dear Lord!, he look like you
Floating high,
up in the sky..."
Pop,"Just something about you
The way I'm lookin at you whatever
You keep lookin at me
You gettin scared now, right?
Don't fear me baby, it's just destiny
It feel good right?
Listen

I kind of noticed, from one night
>From the club, your front face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me your face will change

If you smiling, that should set the tone
Just be limber
If you let go, the music should groove your bones
Just remember
Sing this song with me

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

People are so phony
Nosy coz they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hatin
When it doesn't matter anyway
Coz we're here tonight

If you smiling, that should set the tone
Just be limber baby
If you let go, the music should groove your bones
Baby just remember
Sing this song with me

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

Yeah, you know I can make ya happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance
To be your man
I won't let you down baby
If you give me that chance
To be your man
Here baby, put on my jacket
And then ...

Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just wanna love you baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just wanna love you baby)
Girl ...

[RAP]
Ma, what chu wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
And the mall kids, that's how to change low
>From them you heard ""wow, it's the same glow""
Look at me, I say ""yeah, it's the same dough""
We the same type, you my air of life
You have sleepin in the same bed, er'night

Go rock with me, you deserve the best
Take a few shots
Let it burn in your chest
We could ride down
Pumpin N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play this free, joint called ""brain""
Ma, take a hint
Make me suerve in the lane
The name Malicious
And I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake
Now how heavy is that?

Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just wanna love you baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just wanna love you baby)
Girl ...

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

Break this down

You know, I used to dream about this when I was a
little boy
I never thought it would end up this way, [drums]
It's kind of special right? yeah
You know, you think about it
Sometimes people just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is
Now everybody dance."
Rock,"Come on over to my side, it's where you wanna' be.
Come on over to joy ride, and let your morals be.
Ain't no way to deny it, if it's in your soul.
You don't know 'till you try it, baby, let the good times roll.


Let me taste your life. Let me fill your stream.
Let me make you feel it right now, just lay back and dream.
Got this thing on the move, it's beginin'.
Got a strange kind of feeling, under my skin.


I hear my baby knockin', at my front door.
She knows what I got, she wants some more.
And when it's all over, I start to come down.
Think of the restin' place, I'll leave the ground

I see you see me standing on my own
Is it you that I'm walking through
Should I retrace my point of view
I'm left in clouded dreams of finding who
Not Columbine
Just incase you're my disguise
I found yourself to my surprise
I'm on the ground
And it's Harlequin who fix me up
Who catches you
Who wanishes me
From finding who

Blood by my thorn

Holy Father, why not ask forgiveness
From the land

End this suffering

Of the children
By distorting what love means

Pop,"Never thought that we would end up here
We should've known it from the start
I know you mean it when you say you love me
But we trying way too hard

Used to think that we would last forever
How could I've been so wrong
Never thought that I'd be the one to say this
But if our time has come and gone

You, you don't mean no harm
But you stringin' me along
And I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breath
But you're suffocating me
This time I'm coming up for air

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, air
Reh, eh, eh eh, eh, eh, air

Always tryna put your two cents in
Then expecting me to change
Tryna fix me up but I'm not broken
All you do is leave me stained

Told you not to tell me that too quickly
Take it slow it's not a race
And you keep on tryna reel me in, but
All I really need is space

You, you don't mean no harm
But you stringin' me along
and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breath
But you're suffocating me

Tried to hold me down but I'm surfacing
It's hard to let you go but I gotta leave

And I, I'm trying hard to breath
But you suffocating me, I'm coming up for air

Rock,"Outside these, four walls lies, anarchy babe
Unnatural acts and sights abound
Glass glaring, eyes staring, young pairing, maybe
What does the world care if I'm not around

Cos, I think I'd rather stay at home
With people I know
I could watch the whole thing on TV
And the neighbours never know

The bright lights, are like traps, for the unwary
You need a guard just to walk at night
Fights flaring, bombs scaring, pants tearing, maybe
How can you say it will be alright

And, I think I'd rather stay at home
And my face not show
I could watch the whole thing on TV
And the neighbours never know, they'd never know
Cos, I think I'd rather stay at home
Where cold winds don't blow
I could watch the whole thing on TV
And the neighbours never know, they'd never know

Outside these, four shores lie, countries of strangers
They have water that you shouldn't drink
Bad driving, crime thriving, life's full of dangers
It's not that I'm frightened to walk on the brink.

But I think I'd rather stay at home
With people I know
I could watch the whole thing on TV
And the neighbours never know, they'd never know
Think I'd rather stay at home
Where the bad guys never go, they never go
Stay at home
With people you know, people you know
Think I'd rather stay at home
Where the pimples never show, they never show
Stay at home
Stay at home

I see some guy
Steaming over me
He's smirking sleazy
Probably be older than daddy
Since you smiled
My expression has changed
Come any closer
Things will be constrained
I walk pass looking good
Doesn't give you the right
To put that hand where you think that you should

Not this girl, not this world
Just step off, had enough
You're no good, I'm no fool
I just don't need this
Not this girl, not this world
Just step off, had enough
You're no good, I'm no fool
I just don't need this

I don't want any man to tell me what to do
Anyone to say to me my feelings are not true
For your information
I maintain my station
Feel so incredible
Don't need no man to tell me where yo go
Cos this is all you know

Not this girl, not this world
Just step off, had enough
You're no good, I'm no fool
I just don't need this
Not this girl, not this world
Just step off, had enough
You're no good, I'm no fool
I just don't need this

I'll go wherever I know that you won't go
I don't have to tango with your ego
And it's just because I said so
They way I'm feeling now is mental
The problem first starts in your dentail
I can't believe they let you in 'dis place
But have they seen the look on your face

Not this girl, not this world
Just step off, had enough
You're no good, I'm no fool
I just don't need this
Not this girl, not this world
Just step off, had enough

Rock,"I’m gonna make a mistake
I’m gonna do it on purpose
I’m gonna waste my time
Cuz I’m full as a tick
And I’m scratching at the surface
And what I find is mine
And when the day is done, and I look back
And the fact is I had fun, fumbling around
All the advice I shunned, and I ran
Where they told me not to run, but I sure
Had fun, so
I’m gonna fuck it up again
I’m gonna do another detour
Unpave my path
And if you wanna make sense
Whatcha looking at me for
I’m no good at math
And when I find my way back,
The fact is I just may stay, or I may not
I’ve acquired quite a taste
For a well-made mistake
I wanna mistake why can’t I make a mistake?
I’m always doing what I think I should
Almost always doing everybody good
Why-
Do I wanna do right, of course but
Do I really wanna feel I’m forced to
Answer you, hell no
I’ve acquired quite a taste
For a well-made mistake, I wanna
Make a mistake, why can’t I make a mistake
I’m always doing what I think I should
Almost always doing everybody good
Why

Turn to nothing and then multiply
Yourself by pain,
And you're not even close Elizabeth

Over you I will never be,
I wish I knew why
It never comes to me,

I'm waiting for someone who just wont show
And every night it feels like there's no tomorrow
Not that you will ever know,

Where ever you are I hope you're happy now
I'm caught in a dream and I can't get out
I'm caught in a dream
I'm caught in an endless dream

And I'm not strong enough to let you go,
And I have tried everything
But that

Rock,"My cat's name is Maceo
He's a little man in a cat's body
He yawns just like I do
He's convinced I won't eat him

I think he thinks I'm his dad
Becasue I saved him from the pound
Well we went down, down to the pound
And that's where we saw Maceo

Cat catcher said to me, ""Pick one out,""
Maceo said ""Let me out""
He sleeps right where I do
And we wrestle in the morning!

He come to you if you don't bother him
He just likes to do his own thing
My cat's name is Maceo
He's a little man in a cat's body"

Rock,"Every little thing that I felt that day
Never will forget, there was love in the air
I wasn't looking for love to come my way
Ooh baby baby but then I saw you there

That summer day that I recall
You came into my life
And you gave me hope and love
I just want to be what you want me to
That summer day that changed it all
You came into my life
And you let me fall in love
My baby I just want to be with you

I just want to let it shine
I just want to let it shine
I just want to let it shine

Did you ever think you knew everything?
Did you ever think you had it all figured out?
Ooh baby baby
You know things can change
But someone loves you with no doubt

That summer day that I recall
You came into my life
And you gave me hope and love
I just want to be what you want me to
That summer day that changed it all
You came into my life
And you let me fall in love
My baby I just want to be with you

Can you hear me, baby?
When I say I'm for you
I knew we could make it
The moment you came into my life
Don't you know that you keep me shining

That summer day that I recall
You came into my life
And you gave me hope and love
I just want to be what you want me to
That summer day that changed it all
You came into my life
And you let me fall in love
My baby I just want to be with you

And I'm gonna let it shine
Yeah, I'm gonna let it shine
Yes, I'm gonna let it shine

I just want to let it shine
I just want to let it shine"
Rock,"Been getting tired of my motor running
Feeling overheated 'cause my life keeps coming
My heart's been troubled by the speed of love
Searching these streets for a soul committee
Talking ideas on lust and pity
The fables I've found have no place in my home

Well, I need you
To want me, hold me, tell me the truth
Yeah, I need you
To want me, hold me, tell me the truth

Ain't no party in a sad sad city
Ain't no party in a sad sad city

Well, we roll the dice, pay the price
Dance with wolves in a pack of lies
The blood we crave will drive us all insane
Outer space is a lovely place
A long lost love in a flower vase
Laying on the floor shattered, battered and bruised

Well, I need you
To want me, hold me, tell me the truth
Yeah, I need you
To want me, hold me, tell me the truth

Ain't no party in a sad sad city
Ain't no party in a sad sad city

Well, I need you
To want me, hold me, tell me the truth
Yeah, I need you

Rock,"Seems I got to have a change in scene,
'Cause every night I have the strangest dreams.
Imprisoned by the way things used to be, yeah,
Left here on my own or so it seems.
I got to leave before I start to scream,
'Cause somebody locked the door and took the key.


CHORUS
Feelin' alright? I'm not feelin' too good myself.
Feelin' alright? I'm not feelin' too good myself.


Oooo, Oooo, Oooo, Oooo, Oooo-ooo.


Baby, you sure took me on one big ride,
And, even now I sit and wonder why.
Then, when I think of you, I start to cry,
I know I can't get upset and I must keep dry.
I got to stop believin' in all your lies,
'Cause I got too much to do before I die.

Oooo, Oooo, Oooo, Oooo, Oooo-ooo.

Oh, yeah.

Rock,"In the summer that I was baptized my father held me to his side
As they put me to the water he said how on that day I cried
We were prisoners of love a love in chains
He was standin' in the door I was standin' in the rain
With the same hot blood burning in our veins
Adam raised a Cain

All of the old faces ask you why you're back
They fit you with position and the keys to your daddy's Cadillac
In the darkness of your room your mother calls you by your true name
You remember the faces the places the names
You know it's never over it's relentless as the rain
Adam raised a Cain

In the Bible Cain slew Abel and East of Eden he was cast
You're born into this life paying for the sins of somebody else's past
Daddy worked his whole life for nothing but the pain
Now he walks these empty rooms looking for something to blame
You inherit the sins you inherit the flames
Adam raised a Cain

Lost but not forgotten from the dark heart of a dream
Adam raised a Cain
"
Rock,"I'm so glad you're awake
That you're not like the others
Cause they're so straight-laced
And no fun
Gosh that's nice
That lingerie
Makes me feel like
Oh, I don't know

You're a very pretty thing
You remind me of someone
You must have heard
Some awful nasty things about me, but

What I can do for you
There's no one else
On God's green earth can do
What I can do for you
There's no one else
On God's green earth can do

Just ask anybody
They'll tell you that it's true
There's no one else on earth
Can do the things that I can do for you

You're never gonna make it
All by yourself
You're gonna need a friend
You're gonna need my help
I have so much to offer
If you just be nice
If you do what I say
And don't make me say it twice

Do you mind if I just
Rub my hand up thus
Come on just my hand
Come on just my hand
You got to understand
I'm gonna be your man
I'm gonna be your man
You're gonna need me

Rock,"Yesterday's a by-line, words upon a page
Tomorrow is a deadline, sudden and it's strange
Hard To Believe
You ever would leave, but you did
Hard To Believe
You ever would leave

Nowhere to go, can't sit still
Look for a motive in the time that I kill
Thinking of ways
To fill up my empty days, to fill up my empty days

Hard To Believe
u'd leave when I need you
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe
Hard To Believe
You'd leave when I need you
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe

Love is such a fine line, the finest line I've known
But sorrow is no life line when you're all alone

Hard To Believe
You ever would leave, but you did
Hard To Believe
You ever would leave

Can't sleep a wink, up all night
The truth hurts, you know it cuts like a knife
Thinking of ways
To fill up my empty life, to fill up my empty life

Hard To Believe
You'd leave when I need you
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe
Hard To Believe
You'd leave when I need you
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe

I should be playing in the winter snow

Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chillin' with my folks, I know

Reindeers flying through the sky so high

And it led me to a miracle

Aye love, don't you buy me nothing

Sings a song...
Sounds like she's singing...
Whoo... whoo... whoo...
Just like the white winged dove...
Sings a song...
Sounds like she's singing...
Ooo baby... ooo... said ooo

And the days go by...
Like a strand in the wind...
In the web that is my own...
I begin again
Said to my friend, baby...
Nothin' else mattered

He was no more... than a baby then
Well he... seemed broken hearted...
Something within him
But the moment... that I first laid...
Eyes... on... him... all alone...
On the edge of... seventeen

Just like the white winged dove...
Sings a song...
Sounds like she's singing...
ooo baby... ooo... said ooo...
Just like the white winged dove...
Sings a song...
Sounds like she's singing...
Ooo baby... ooo... said ooo

I went today... maybe I will go again...
Tomorrow
And the music there it was hauntingly...
Familiar
And I see you doing...
What I try to do for me
With the words from a poet...
And the voice from a choir
And a melody... nothing else mattered

Just like the white winged dove...
Sings a song...

Sings a song...
Sounds like she's singing...

When it rains
But the sea changes colours...
But the sea...
Does not change

Desire... to please
On the edge of... seventeen

Sings a song...
Sounds like she's singing...
Ooo baby... ooo... said ooo
Just like the white winged dove...
Sings a song...
Sounds like she's singing...
Ooo baby... ooo... said ooo

Well then suddenly...
There was no one... left standing
In the hall... yeah yeah...
In a flood of tears
That no one really ever heard fall at all
Oh I went searchin' for an answer...
Up the stairs... and down the hall
Not to find an answer...
Just to hear the call
Of a nightbird... singing...
Come away... come away...

Just like the white winged dove...
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing...
Ooo... baby ooo... said ooo
Just like the white winged dove...
Sings a song...
Sounds like she's singing...
Ooo... baby ooo... said ooo

Well I hear you in the morning...
And I hear you...
At nightfall...
Sometime to be near you...
Is to be unable... to hear you...
My love...
I'm a few years older than you...

Sings a song...
Sounds like she's singing...

She's a woman in love
And he's gonna break her heart to pieces
She don't wanna see
She's a woman in love, but it's not me

Well alright, do what you want
Don't try to talk, don't say nothin'
She used to be the kind of woman
You have and you hold, she could understand the problem
She let the little things go

Chorus
She's a woman in love
And he's gonna break her heart to pieces
But she don't wanna know
She's a woman in love, she can't let go

Time after time, night after night
She would look up at me
And say she was lonely
I don't understand the world today
I don't understand what she needed
I gave her everything she threw it all away
On nothin'
She's a woman in love"
Pop,"Girl we made it to the top
We went so high we couldn't stop
We climbed the ladder leading us nowhere
Two of us together
Building castles in the air

We spun so fast we couldn't tell
The gold ring from the carousel
How could we know the ride would turn out bad
Everything we wanted
Was everything we had

I miss the hungry years
The once upon a time
The lovely long ago
We didn't have a dime
Those days of me and you
We lost along the way

How could I be so blind
Not to see the door
Closing on the world
I now hunger for
Looking through my tears
I miss the hungry years

We shared our daydreams one by one
Making plans was so much fun
We set our goals and reached the highest star
The things that we were after
Were much better from afar

Here we stand just me and you
With everything and nothing, too
It wasn't worth the price we had to pay
Honey take me home
Let's go back to yesterday

I miss the hungry years
The once upon a time
The lovely long ago
We didn't have a dime
Those days of me and you
We lost along the way

How could I be so blind
Not to see the door
Closing on the world
I know hunger for
Looking through my tears
I miss the hungry years
I miss the hungry years"

What of your sons?

To face the gun

Our bright future
Is in our past

To our father
What of reason?
Say what you will
Believe
What you want
The record shows
What we are not
Our true desires
Not

To take the path
Where

What have you done?
To the children
Born innocent
But come to harm
For dreams of glory
And just a line
In history

Led on led on
To take the path
Where
Our bright future
Is in our past

To our father
What good may come?
To let the children
Walk alone
To fear to fail
And need no savior
To be at peace
In our true nature

Lead on Lead on
Clear the path
So
Our bright future
May come to pass
May come to pass

but where were you now
was you gonna tell me in time
just give me a town
and I'll be straight down

I've got so much to tell you
about where I have been
as I walk down your road
I can't wait to be near you

I saw his face
was shining
he had my eyes (my eyes)
he had my smile (my smile)

Lipstick on my naked shoulder
It seems to be my fancy to make it with
Franky and Sue Ann

Over the bridge we go
Looking for love
Over the bridge we go
Looking for love
I'll come running to you, hey baby if you want me
I'll come running to you, baby if you want me

Looking at my hands today
Look to me that they're made of ivory
I had a funny call today
Someone died and someone married
you know that it's my fancy to make it with
Franky and Sue Ann

Over the bridge they go
Looking for love
Over the bridge we go
Looking for love
I'll come running to you, hey baby if you want me
I'll come running to you, baby if you want me

Something's got a hold on me
And I don't know what

Something's got a hold on me
And I don't know what

It's the beginning of a new age
It's the beginning of a new age

It's new age"
Pop,"Hope things will get better 'cause that's what I need
I think about the good times that we had and now I see that you are
living in two different places and I don't think it's gonna be a change

But I'm never gonna leave it I'm always gonna keep it In my heart
In my heart
I'll keep it all together
In my heart
I know it's gonna be better
In my heart

You said that it should never be like this and
when I was a little child I never had this on my mind
But now it is like it is and I don't think it's gonna be a change

But I'm never gonna leave it I'm always gonna keep it In my heart

Rock,"Everybody's cool playing rock n roll
Everybody's cool playing rock n roll
I don't feel cool at all
I don't feel cool at all
Send all of my best out to the hand
I don't think I'll make it out to the show
There's this girl I can't get out of my head
There's this girl I can't get out of my head
And I don't feel so cool at all
"
Rock,"Baby
I used to watch your flowers grow
Now it's raining and all your petals turns to stone
I've been praying
I turn around and see my rose
But you faded
You left me now its time to go

That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
It may be to late our time is done
That's why I´m long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
It may be to late our time is done

Baby
I think you've got your timing wrong
Hating
Exploring this while we're riding on
And its crazy to think that I could be reborn
If you saved me
Now it's to late and you'll never know

You're like a diamond and I'm like glass
Like oil and water we always clash
Sometimes my confessions are hard for me
I'll tell you now I'm setting you free

That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
It may be to late our time is done
That's why I´m long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
It may be to late our time is done

With broken wings
I can't fly
I'm gonna need you to save me, angel of mine
With broken wings (with broken wings)
I can't fly (I can't fly)
I'm gonna need you to save me, angel of mine (2x)

That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
It may be to late our time is done
That's why I´m long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
It may be to late our time is done"
Pop,"Loving you, I thought I couldn't get no higher
Your november rain could set night on fire
Night on fire
But we could only burn so long
Counterfeit emotions only run skin deep
Know you're lying when you're lying next to me
Next to me

How did we get so far gone?
I should know by now, you should know by now
We should know by now

Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go

I have never heard a silence quite so loud
I walk in the room and you don't make a sound
Make a sound
You're good at making me feel small
If it doesn't hurt me, why do I still cry?
If it didn't kill me, then I'm half alive
Half alive

How did we get so far gone?
I should know by now, you should know by now
We should know by now

Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go

I should know by now, you should know by now
I think I'm breaking right now
I should know by now, you should know by now
I think I'm breaking right now

Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go
Something's gotta give"
Rock,"Well my name is Catherine LeFevre
I work at the Astrowash on Sunset and Vine
I drop my kids at school in the morning
And I pick them up at Mary's just 'fore suppertime

CHORUS:
Well I work down at the car wash
For a dollar and a dime
And mister, I hate my boss
It's at the car wash I'm doing my time
Pick up my water bottle and my towel, sir
And I take 'em one by one
From Mercedes to VWs
I do 'em all and I don't favor none

(CHORUS)

Well someday I'll sing in a night club
I'll get a million-dollar break
A handsome man will come here with a contract in his hand
And say ""Catherine, this has all been some mistake""

Pop,"Time up in the middle of a daydream
Call you up 'cause the time is wasted
Let's drive, we got nowhere to go
Fear not, yeah, welcome to the jungle
Think fast, move quick, don't stumble
We can't do this alone

Where do we go? We don't know
Follow the wind where it blows
Let's make mistakes and don't look back
It's now or never

One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights

We're young, live with no fear
Kids running wild
Girls crying dove tears
We don't have this time for long
Yeah, we make big plans
Spending all our change
Cut up in the night, oh we missed the last train
It' our time and we're leaving home

Where do we go? We don't know
Follow the wind where it blows
Let's make mistakes and don't look back
It's now or never

One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights

Wanna hold on tight to a little of this
Come now you don't want to miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights

Wanna hold on tight to a little of this
Come now you don't want to miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights

Go home it's over, but it's not the end
Don't wait 'til you're older to begin
Keep your composure and innocence
Where do we go? We don't know
One of those nights, we're driving around
And it's pouring us down
One of those nights

Wanna hold on tight to a little of this
Come now you don't want to miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights

One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights

Wanna hold on tight to a little of this
Come now you don't want to miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights

One of those nights, where she turns those lights down
And it's only us now
One of those nights"
Pop,"Here come the night
In your eyes
Baby, be brave
Be wise
It's up to you
You do what you like, mm
Won't you give it a chance, baby?
Just one more try

Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me

(Won't you give it a chance, baby?)
Won't you give it a chance, baby?
Just one more try
One more try
Yeah, eh

You got the power
You set the price
But baby, be fair
Be nice
You say you want to be happy
Then you got to put your love on the line
Just let me make you smile again, baby
I know we can work it out
Yes, I know we can

Baby forgive me
Yeah
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me

Pop,"You know we don't care at all
Let, let me see you up, up against the wall

Two step

I was just doin' my thing
Hanging out at the spot
You know the place we go
The music's John Blaze hot
And everybody was feeling the DJ
Smoke cleared and I saw a beautiful lady
The lights went low and the disco ball came down
She walked up to me slow and you know what happens now
The girl was fine and she knew she had game
What more do I have to say

CHORUS
She took my hand
We never said a word at all
We started grinding
She already had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow
You know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up when she had me up against the wall

You know we don't care at all
(Just get caught up when you're up against the wall)
(We don't, we don't care at all)
You know we don't care at all, let, let me see up, up against the wall

It's almost 2 o'clock
It's time to make my move
The after hours spot
Is where I'm going to
'Cause I gotta have some more
Looking for somebody to hit the dance floor
And lucky for me I see a fine young lady's eyeing me
The lights are low and her friends were all around
I walked up to her so and you know what happens now
She turned around and she worked it the worst way
What more do I have to say

She took my hand
We never said a word at all
We started grinding
She already had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow
You know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up when she had me up against the wall
She already had me up against the wall

Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the cutest one you saw?
She's underneath the disco ball. The disco ball? The disco ball.
Standing next to strobe lights, dancin' hot, lookin' tight
The freaks sure do come out at night, out at night, night, night, night
What more (whoo) do I have to say

Two step

She took my hand
We never said a word at all
We started grinding
She already had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow
You know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up when she had me up against the wall

She took my hand
We never said a word at all
We started grinding
She already had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow
You know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up when she had me up against the wall

I just got caught up when you had me up against the wall

We don't, we don't care at all

You know we don't care at all
Just get caught up when you're up against the wall

We don't, we don't care at all

You know we don't care at all
Let, let me see you up, up against the wall

We don't, we don't care at all

You know we don't care at all
Just get caught up when you're up against the wall

We don't, we don't care at all

You know we don't care at all
Let, let me see you up, up against the wall

Rock,"Well I rode that ribbon highway
I saw above me the endless sky
I saw below me the golden valley
This land was made for you and me

I've roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps
Through the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
And all around me a voice was calling
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land
This land is my land
From California
To the New York island
From the Redwood Forest
To the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

Well the sun came shining and I was strolling
Through wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling
And a voice was sounding
As the fog was lifting
Saying this land was made for you and me

This land is your land
This land is my land
From California
To the New York island
From the Redwood Forest
To the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

He was knocked down, knock down loaded

Well I'd pawn my silver pen
I would pawn my watch and chain
I would pawn my pretty Isabella
But the poor gal can't sign her name

Down the road, down the road come

He was knocked down, knocked down loaded

And a year just ain't no time
We got boys down in Angola
Serving one to ninety-nine

He was loaded as he could be

Rock,"He walked 300 miles
Just to bring me bread
His body like a sculpture
Almost decorated
and I’ll wake him as the dawn does
and we’ll break it on the bus
saying, “this was made for us, love”

In lovers communion for 500 miles
And in 500 miles will he break
Break me again?
In lovers communion for 500 miles
And in 500 miles will we brake
Even break

Step it up
Grab your phone
Get your suitcase
There is no time to waste
A big adventure awaits
Sad news, France suffered a late snow
The blooms break through the ice

In San Francisco
A guitar man finally confessed
He left that actress
Over the lakes with hearts touched by frost
We fought in the Land of the Midnight Sun
I lost myself
I lost myself

I walk 300 miles
Just to bring
To bring him bread
In love some gifts are simple
Others I underrated
So I’ll wake him as the dawn does
And we’ll face what any lovers must
Blueness pales within a flames lust

In lovers communion for 500 miles
And in 500 miles will he break
Break me again?
In lovers communion for 500 miles
And in 500 miles will he brake
Even break
will we brake
Even break
Brake
Even brake
Don’t slow down
We might not even break

Pop,"Ever since I was a little girl even younger than I am now
I always felt good about you in a special way, I don't know how
And we always seem to find our way back to the love that we are sharing
And every time we say it's over I can't forget your sweet loving
After every time we break up, thing always turn out the same
I tell myself that I have shaped up, but I am still a part of this game

You always seem to come back into my life
When I thought I've forgotten you, you always show up
It's drivin' me crazy, it's got me going wild
And I don't know if this is ever gonna stop
You always seem to come back into my world
And this time I hope we're staying on track
'Cause I don't wanna be anybodyelses girl
I hope this is the last time you'll ever come back

I want you back 'cause you're a good man,
The kinda' man who loves you all through the night
And though it never turns like I planned
Somehow it feels so right
So this time, boy don't turn away
'Cause you'll always have a place in my heart
And I swear I'm goona love 'til the day,
'til the day that death do us part

Chorus

I don't have the strength to be proud anymore
I want it all to be just like before
I guess what I'm really tryin' to say
Is that I want you to come back,
Come back to stay 'cause I love you
('cause I really love you)
want to (I just want to)
get closer (get much closer)
than ever (more than ever)
'Cause I love you

When I'm down you bring me up and when I'm up you bring me down
So what am I supposed to do when all I want is to get back with you baby

And of thoughts unkind

Love cleans the mind
And makes it Free
Free

Dragons have been bled

Only in your Head
Fear is in your Head
Only in your Head
So Forget your Head
And you'll be free
The writing's on the wall
Free-yeah, And you can know it all
If you choose. Just remember
Lovers never lose
'Cause they are free of thoughts unpure
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love will clean your the mind
And make you Free!!

Free-yeah Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Free-yeah Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Free-yeah Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Free-yeah Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah

Rock,"This ain't rock'n'roll. This is genocide!

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Tod Browning's freak you was

Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The diamond dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal

(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone.
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzie, go man go

Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralyzed, Diamond Dogs are sableized

(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone.
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs

In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
(There's gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow

(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone.
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Bow-wow, woof woof, bow-wow, wow
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them, ooo
Call them the Diamond Dogs

Keep cool
Diamond Dogs rule, OK
Hey-hey-hey-hey

Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs

Pop,"Feet on the driveway
Key in the door
I found my suitcase on the living room floor
With no explanation, and no reason why
And all I keep thinking is, it's some other guy
I jumped on my Vespa
Ride through the gloom
I found myself back in my old bedroom
Well, I'm going out to get over you
Ain't no such thing as ""it's too soon""

I'm OK
I'm gonna live the life I wanted every day
Find someone to help me
Chase the clouds away
If you wanna know it's written on my face
When you see me smiling
I'm OK

Maybe you'll miss me or maybe you won't
Still miss my kisses or maybe you don't
But the truth of it is
I don't care anymore
Posted back all my feelings
With my keys through the door

Cos I can't wait for that knock on the door
When you tell me that
You want it like we had it before
Cos I got to say, that love aint here anymore
But don't you worry your head 'cos

Chorus
I'm OK
I'm gonna live the life I wanted every day
Find someone to help me
Chase the clouds away
If you wanna know it's written on my face
When you see me smiling
I'm OK
Cos I know you're gonna turn up here one day
And some pretty girl is sitting in your place
Well I hope that you cope with that bitter taste

When you see me smiling
I'm OK

Broken pieces held together
I'm not whole still, but whatever"

Rock,"She's natural in her beauty
I guess you could say she's
An unapproachable comedienne
Haven't much faith in her talent
But she did her work
No comedienne has not been a clown
She did her work
But her heart was quietly crying
I guess she even felt guilty
'Bout even dying
Sad mabel normand

So my friend is continuing
On a destructive road
His life passes before him like an
Unfortunate circumstance
He and his friend are at odds
And he is not winning
Why does someone always have to win?
He says it matters
Strange things do follow when you love someone
So you put that someone in exile
How 'bout I call you beloved exile

He called today
Says, ""don't give up""
I ask him, ""what are you talking about? ""
I said things are not the same
Since you've been gone rome burned down

And it's still all the same
So I moved away from the house that held nothing
But waiting for messages
And all through the day's seasons
I went running with the sun
And I prayed every day for the answers
In a still and almost silent night
He began to hide his beauty
And I learned to say the words
Well, just whose side are you on, anyway?

You change sides
What does it matter?
Still you change... Sides
Every other day you just change sides
So, continue on your destructive road
Your life passes before me
Like an unknown circumstance
You and your friend are at odds

And you are not winning
But why does someone always have to win?
And all those races that are run
They cause patterns
Strange things do follow when you love someone
So you put that someone in exile
And you say, ""I'll write a book about it and call it beloved exile""

Well, her life was a gas
Simply everything that happened
Well, the old lady said, yes it was sad
She fought a losing battle
One day at a time
She might even make it through tomorrow
Maybe even another show, natural in her beauty
I guess you could just say she was unapproachable
Baby, comedienne

So beautiful
So beautiful
She fought a losing battle
She might even make it through tomorrow
So beautiful
So beautiful
Sad mabel normand
Sad girl
Sad girl

Rock,"It started as a joke
Just one of my larks to see
If somehow I could reach you
So I swam into your shores
Through an open window
Only to find you all alone
Curled up with machines
Now it seems you're slipping
Out of the land of the living

Just take a closer look
Take a closer look
At what it is that's really haunting you
I have to trust you now
This digital ghost
But I fear there's only so much time
'Cause the you I knew is fading away

Hands, lay them on my keys
Let me play you again
I am not immune to your net
Find me there in it
I won't go even if in
Your heart only beats 1 and 0's
Switch you on, my friend
Pull you from that rip current
But only you can fight against this

Take a closer look
Just take a closer look
At what it is that's really haunting you
I have to trust you now
This digital ghost
But I fear there's only so much time
'Cause the you I knew is fading away

Fading
Fading away"
Pop,"Done so many things wrong I don't know if I can do right
Oh I Oh I've
Done so many things wrong I don't know if I can do right
At this point in my life
I've done so many things wrong I don't know if I can do right
If you put your trust in me I hope I won't let you down
If you give me a chance I'll try
You see it's been a hard road the road I'm traveling on
And if I take your hand I might lead you down the path to ruin
I've had a hard life I'm just saying it so you'll understand
That right now, right now, I'm doing the best I can

At this point in my life
At this point in my life
Although I've mostly walked in the shadows
I'm still searching for the light
Won't you put your faith in me
We both know that's what matters
If you give me a chance I'll try
You see I've been climbing stairs but mostly stumbling down
I've been reaching high always losing ground
You see I've been reaching high but always losing ground
You see I've conquered hills but I still have mountains to climb
And right now right now I'm doing the best I can
At this point in my life

Before we take a step
Before we walk down that path
Before I make any promises
Before you have regrets
Before we talk commitment
Let me tell you of my past
All I've seen and all I've done
The things I'd like to forget

At this point in my life
At this point in my life
I'd like to live as if only love mattered
As if redemption was in sight
As if the search to live honestly
Is all that anyone needs
No matter if you find it

You see when I've touched the sky
The earth's gravity has pulled me down
But now I've reconciled that in this world
Birds and angels get the wings to fly
If you can believe in this heart of mine
If you can give it a try
Then I'll reach inside and find and give you
All the sweetness that I have
At this point in my life
At this point in my life"

We keep walking away for no reason at all
And no one says a word
We were always so busy protecting ourselves
We never would have heard
And the rate of attrition for lovers like us
Is steadily on the rise
Nobody's in love this year
Not even you and I

Due to lack of commitment on both of our parts
We're going our separate ways
This show of indifference is breaking our hearts
It's making us crazy, yeah
You sit back and wait for your love to accrue
You'll be waiting a long, long time
Nobody's in love this year
Not even you and I

I don't want to be Mr. Vulnerable
I don't want to get hurt
I don't want to be Mr. Vulnerable
I don't want to be the one who gets left behind

We keep walking away for no reason at all
For the sake of being free
No one's invested enough of themselves
To yield to maturity
And the rate of attrition for lovers like us
Is steadily on the rise
Nobody's in love this year
Nobody wants to try
Nobody's in love this year
Not even you and I

I don't want to be Mr. Vulnerable
I don't want to get hurt
I don't want to be Mr. Vulnerable
I don't want to be the one who gets left behind

We don't choose who we love
We don't choose

The lights over the Midway melt on the street
In a Sunday shoes, with her Saturday feet
She don't love who he choose
She don't need what she use

Daylight comes and exposes
Saturday's bruises and cold roses
Cold roses

Nothing but the sunlight will help you grow
From underneath your bed you can't see the window
We don't choose what we see
We don't choose

Fortunate and angry just like a child
All that money buys you medicine but can't buy you time
We don't choose what we love
And she don't need what she got

Daylight comes and exposes
Saturday's bruises and cold roses
Cold roses

Cold roses
Cold roses

I've got soldier lips
Hungry for health!
For whatever better comes around
Hungry for your love
Blood drips of the sight
Of my side

And I'm running for my life
And I can't see the end of times
And I'll see you at the end
And I'll be another man
And I really hope you understand!
Soldier lips
I've got soldier lips
Soldier lips
I feel just like a fool
Backing time of school
And I'll be with you at the end
But you never, never understand
I just want to be alone

Of whoever good comes around
But I'm always over my ground
Trying on the long run to give
The best to you

Rock,"Orange and red beams
In and out
Peek through my window
In the night
The baby was born
Before a storm
And now I believe them
What they said
The thousand people
Who aren't really dead
The baby was born
Before a storm
And now a fate calls him a mile away
'Cause orange and red beams
Yes, are here to stay

Now I believe him
Before I escape
The thousand people
Do not really care
The baby was born
Before a storm

Rock,"I wish I had a talking book
that told me how to act and look
A talking book that contained keys
to past and present memories

A talking book that said your name
so if you were gone, you'd still remain
More than a picture on a shelf
in imagination I could touch

A talking, talking book

I wish I had a talking book
filled with buttons you could push
Containing looks and sights, your touch
your feel, your breath, your sounds, your sighs

How much I'd bluster to ask it why
one must live and one must die

I wish I had a talking book
by my side so I could look
And touch and feel and dream, a look
much bigger than a talking book
A taste of loving future and past
is that so much to really ask
In this one moment's time and space
can our love really be replaced
By a talking book

Can our love really be replaced
by a talking book
Can our love really be replaced
by a talking book
Can our love ever, forever be replaced
Can our love ever be replaced

Can our love ever be replaced
(can our love really be replaced)
By a talking book

Run out of reasons and misunderstood
Run out of rhythm,
run out of rhyme
Right Out of feelings
And right out of time

Living in limbo, hanging around
Head on the ceiling
And mind in the clouds

Blind is the morning
But deaf is the night
Comes without warning
And leaves me in fright

I've been saving all my money, yeah
For the rainy days
I'm packing up my suitcase
Make it pay

I've run out of patience
I've run out of lies
Run Out of spaces and nowhere to hide
Living end loving is easy to get
But living is something
We haven't tried yet, yeah

I've been saving all my money, yeah
For the rainy days
I'm packing up my suitcase
Make it pay

I've run out of money, run out us good
Run out of reasons and misunderstood

is, that you don't do it for me
you don't forfill my life,

Not charmed at all
Not sayin
that you weren't
the fall
But I was alone when
I knew it was real
Down the canyon
when I knew I had come

To the line
Through the dawn
to the light
To the turn
When you said -

You could drive
all night
Dive all night

So I let Crazy
take a spin
Then I let Crazy
settle in
Kicked off my shoes
Shut reason out
He said ""first let's just
unzip your religion
down""

Found that I
I craved it all
Saw me melt
into your
native shelter
Where you carved my
name
Paper tigers scare me
and came

Alive
Through the dawn
To the light
To the turn
When you said -

You could drive
all night
Drive all night



So I let Crazy
take a spin
Then I let Crazy
settle in
Kicked off my shoes
Shut reason out
He said ""first let's just
unzip your religion
down""
So I let Crazy
pull me in
Then I let Crazy
take his spin
Kicked off my shoes
Shut reason out
He said ""first let's just
unzip your religion
down
Heard that you were once
Temptations's girl""

And as soon
as you have
rearranged the mess
in your head
He will show up looking
sane
perfectly sane
If I know Crazy"

Throw up your hands

Close your eyes
And bow your head
To rest your soul
And to praise the dead

Throw up your hands

The body is gone

Dry your eyes
And stand upright
Put a smile on your face
He wouldn't want us to cry

The sun will rise
The stars will shine
Turning day to dusk
And night to dawn
We'll pass on
But until that time

Say Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Say Hallelujah

Say Hallelujah
Throw up your hands
The bucket is kicked
The body is gone

Have mercy
It's a wonderful life
Eternal rest for the weary
Mourners party tonight

Say Hallelujah
Throw up your hands
The bucket is kicked
The body is gone

Wave your hands
But don't say goodbye
We're all gonna meet you
On the other side"

bless your children, give them names,
Don't trust men who walk with canes,
drink this and you'll grow wings on your feet
Broadway Mary, Joan Fontaine, advertiser on a downtown train
Christmas crier bustin' cane, He's in love again.

Where dock worker's dreams mix with panther's schemes to someday own the rodeo
Tainted women in Vistavision perform for out-of-state kids at the late show.

Wizard imps and sweat sock pimps, interstellar mongrel nymphs
Rex said that lady left him limp. Love's like that (sure it is).
Queen of diamonds, ace of spades newly discovered lovers of the everglades
They take out a full page ad in the trades to announce their arrival
And Mary Lou she found out how to cope, she rides to heaven on a gyroscope
The Daily News asks her for the dope
She says ""Man, the dope's that there's still hope""

The things that I have come here to learn
Fire of this pleasure, it can warm me
But in the end it only burns
He could put me high on a pedestal
He could rob me of my shame
He could hold me down under water
Till I could not remember my own name

In my mind, I see the house I’m buildin’
In my hands, the hammer and the nail
Gonna send my wishes up to Glory
Gonna shake that devil off my trail

In my time I’ve done some meanness
Brought the ones I love so much pain
Pride, it was eatin’ all my heart away
My soul it was rustin’ in the rain
And all these sins I am confessin’
They still come knockin’ on my door
But I know better than to answer
I tell them that girl don’t live here anymore

In my mind, I see the house I’m buildin’
In my hands, the hammer and the nail
Gonna send my wishes up to Glory
Gonna shake that devil off my trail

Every livin’ thing is callin’ out to me
The leaves on the trees wave me on
Got a wind to lift me when I’m fallin’
Got a road to put my feet upon

In my mind, I see the house I’m buildin’
In my hands, the hammer and the nail
Gonna send my wishes up to Glory
Gonna shake that devil off my trail

In my mind, I see the house I’m buildin’
In my hands, the hammer and the nail
Gonna send my wishes up to Glory
Gonna shake that devil off my trail

Too low to notice
Superman in disco jeans
Having a good time
Just wish I was here

So separated
Under watergun ballet
When you've got no map
You've got no place to go
Some sexy killjoy
Bring everybody down
Well, I eat confusion
And spit it out slow

Resuscitation
Bring you 'round
Resuscitation
Bring you down
The road is paved with hope and glory
But my shoes are hiding under the bed
I need a little evaluation
Rejuvenation
Of soul and head

So underneath
Hanging on the bathroom rug
Holding it together
With rubber bands and chewing gum
This mansion's crashing
I'm just the butler's maid
What do we care
We just need our own parade

Tear me down

Tell me why you wanna play?

I'm about to get pissed off
You had to keep leading me on
Baby, you thought you had me fooled but I see right through you

Look into my eyes, Tell me what you see
I see a man who thought you loved me
You played me like a fool but I see right through you
I look into your eyes, I'll tell you what I see
I see a girl who maybe lonely
but you had me fooled but i see right through you

Tell me girl what's his name
What'd he do to take you
Does he freak you the way that I do
'Cause you know that I know how to
When he leaves you don't come crying back to me
'Cause I'll be moving on you see
And you'll be just a memory
I think I've had enough

Thought you had me fooled
See right through you!

See see see right through you!

Baby, Tell me does he do it, do it like I do?
Baby, Tell me will he love you, love you like I do?
Now your crying 'cause you can't believe that we are through
I don't care 'cause I see right through you
Let me tell you that this is how it's gonna be
After all we have been through what you have ment to me
And You won't to this too me

Pop,"They never thought I would go so far
They never believed
That I could be a star
They told me things to make me give up
But I knew that I could overcome

I tried not to surrender
I know I was on the right path
They can say what they want
But they can't make me go back
(Chase after your dream)

[Chorus]
Dance like nobody's watching you
Love as if nothing had ever hurt you
Sing like no one could hear you
Live your life
As if it were your last day before you die

They never encouraged me to seek my dream
They didn't realize that was the best of me
They tried everything to bring me down
And so many times, in my tears, I drowned

I tried not to surrender
Not been easy, but I carried on
They can say what they want
But now what's done is done
(Chase after your dream)

[Chorus]
Dance like nobody's watching you
Love as if nothing had ever hurt you
Sing like no one could hear you
Live your life
As if it were your last day before you die
Smile like there's no
Reason to sadden you
Dream as if it were already true
Jump like no one could reach you
Live your life
As if it were your last day before you die

(Rap) feat. Bruno Ximenes
Yeah you can make it
Just believe in yourself and you will make it
You are good, you're a star
You are good the way you are, uh
Forget the haters,
Because they cannot break us
Just keep on singing, keep on dreaming
And keep on believing
Remember no matter what, you're a star
Show them your talent is bigger
Than the dislike bar
Do you have a dream?
So do not give up so easy
Just believe it, you'll get far
(You'll get far)
Come on, now!

Dance like nobody is watching you
Love like nothing ever hurt you
Sing like no one could hear you
Live your life
Like it is the last day before you die

Dance like nobody's watching you
Love as if nothing had ever hurt you
Sing like no one could hear you
Live your life
As if it were your last day before you die
Smile like there's no

Jump like no one could reach you
Live your life
As if it were your last day before you die"

Cause I know you came through the worst
I know it's dark, but don't you worry
If I know love, it shouldn't hurt

Hold on tight in the waves with me now
When the lights go, the lights go down
You'll be safe, you'll be sound
Hold on tight, would you wave with me now?
When the night come, the night come
I'll keep you safe, keep you sound
Hold on tight
Hold on tight
Hold on tight

We are strong, we are steady
We won't fall in the rain
I hold your head when you're hurting
We all love, but we're scared of faith

Hold on tight in the waves with me now
When the lights go, the lights go down
You'll be safe, you'll be sound
Hold on tight, would you wave with me now?
When the night come, the night come
I'll keep you safe, keep you sound
Hold on tight
Hold on tight
Hold on tight

Hold on tight in the waves with me now
When the lights go, the lights go down
You'll be safe, you'll be sound
Hold on tight, would you wave with me now?
When the night come, the night come
I'll keep you safe, keep you sound
Hold on tight
Hold on tight
Hold on tight"
Rock,"I hang my head down on Hollywood
'Cause either way up or down it's just stars
And I'm making my way down the Cherokee
To get drunk in a bar
And I know my friends, they worry about me
I can see it written on their face
Despite anything that I said before
The bar is a beautiful place. . sha na na na, sha la la la la.

I got a cold in my heart that the doctor can't feel
He said ""go get you a beer""
But they don't let the sunshine come in here.
Sha la. Sha la la la

Where the hookers and thieves and the junkies play
It's a circus round here for sure
And I worry about how I'm fitting in
If I only had her
And I know my friends they worry about me
I can see it written on their face
But despite anything I might have said before,
The bar is a beautiful place. . sha na na na, sha la la la la.

Ain't it strange, I see your face in the window of a store
Holding me back from throwing my bottles out at the cars
Sha la. Sha la la la

So hey there, Mrs. Samuels
Hey Laura, I'm thinking of you
Would you take an old drunk as-is
If he was sweet to you
And tomorrow, you'll probably give up on me
I won't blame you, hell I'll celebrate
'Cause despite anything you may have said to me
The bar is a beautiful place. . sha na na na, sha la la."

And you keep acting like you want me
I don't need a little boy

Light it up, I know you want it
Take a bow, let's get high of our love
High off our love

Do you wanna get high off my love, high off my love?
Do you wanna get high off my love, high off my love?
Do you wanna get high off my love, high off my love?

You from Mars, baby?

The night is young, it's time to kill it
Let's turn it up, I know you really want it
I wanna see you, uuh
Go hard as you can, and let it show
You're making me dance, dance, dance

Get my attention, I'm ready to go
My only intention's to give you a show
Light it up, I know you want it

Every summer, 'cause we're the ones to blow the hunnies

Out of work
I need a job, I'm out of work
I'm unemployed, I'm out of work

I can pull a rabbit out of a hat
I can pull it out but I can't put it back
I can make love disappear

It's lonely up here
When the tricks have been played
And the spotlights have faded
And the plans that we made
Have fallen apart

By young clear crystal fountain

That was when I was taken in, and it left its mark on me.
Yeah, she nearly drove me crazy with all those china toys,
And I know she really didn't mean a thing to those sailor boys.

Louisiana rain is falling at my feet.
Baby, I'm noticing a change as I move down the street.
Louisiana rain is soaking through my shoes.
I may never be the same when I reach Baton Rouge.

South Carolina put out its arms for me
Right up until everything went black
Somewhere on lonely street.
And I still can't quite remember,
Who helped me to my feet.
Thank God for a long-neck bottle,
The angels remedy.

Louisiana rain is falling just like tears,
Running down my face, washing out the years.
Louisiana rain is soaking through my shoes.
I may never be the same when I reach Baton Rouge.

Well, I never will get over this English refugee
Singing to the juke-box in some all-nite beanery.
Yeah, he was eating pills like candy
And chasing them with tea.
You should have seen him lick his lips at old black Molly B.

Louisiana rain is falling at my feet.
Baby, I'm noticing a change as I move down the street.
Louisiana rain is soaking through my shoes.
I may never be the same when I reach Baton Rouge.

Louisiana rain is falling just like tears,
Running down my face, washing out the years.
Louisiana rain is soaking through my shoes.
I may never be the same when I reach Baton Rouge."
Rock,"Old pirates, yes, they rob I;
Sold I to the merchant ships,
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit.
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty.
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly.


Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom
'Cause all I ever have:
Redemption songs
Redemption songs

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery;
None but ourselves can free our minds.
Have no fear for atomic energy,
'Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets,
While we stand outside and look
Some say it's just a part of it:
We've got to fulfill the book.

Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom
'Cause all I ever have:
Redemption songs
Redemption songs
Redemption songs

(Guitar break)

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery;
None but ourselves can free our mind.
Wo! Have no fear for atomic energy,
'Cause none of them-a can-a stop-a-the time
How long shall they kill our prophets,
While we stand aside and look?
Yes, some say it's just a part of it:
We've got to fulfil the book.

Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom? -
'Cause all I ever had:
Redemption songs -
All I ever had:
Redemption songs:
These songs of freedom,
Songs of freedom."
Rock,"Fat man sitting on a little stool
Takes the money from my hand while his eyes take a walk all over you
Hands me the ticket smiles and whispers good luck
Cuddle up angel cuddle up my little dove
We'll ride down baby into this tunnel of love

I can feel the soft silk of your blouse
And them soft thrills in our little fun house
Then the lights go out and it's just the three of us
You me and all that stuff we're so scared of
Gotta ride down baby into this tunnel of love

There's a crazy mirror showing us both in 5-D
I'm laughing at you you're laughing at me
There's a room of shadows that gets so dark brother
It's easy for two people to lose each other in this tunnel of love

it ought to be easy ought to be simple enough
Man meets woman and they fall in love
But the house is haunted and the ride gets rough
And you've got to learn to live with what you can't rise above if you want to ride on down in through this tunnel of love

Rock,"If you want it

Come and get it
Mmm, make your mind up fast

Will you walk away
From a fool and his money
If you want it

She likes to do what the boys do, getting dirty on the pitch,
Chanting with the cup crew.

Rock,"Eddie boy lit like paraffin spending two weeks in a crack house
Burns on his brain like Chernobyl

Dean was seen with a two bag purchase
He was lying dead on his mother's bed
Someone for pray for-till I met you

Life is like a broken arrow-memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune-
I can make you happy every day of your life
Making my love like a shining star-takin' my love just a touch too far

Tessie turns tricks with a soul like ice cause love left holes
And four swell kids breaking her heart
I've got windows, I've seen much vice, I've touched down with vermin,
Cowardice, lice,
And I say

Nobody cares what you do-please be yourself to death
I could be your great misfortune
But you'll never find a, bet you'll never find a better man.
Making my love like a shining star
Taking my love just a touch too far.

Peter met Frank formed a dummy run gang
Worked heist or hit for 10 g's flat
Blew heads outta shape for the name of Trotsky,
Sinn-Fein, Hitler cashdown
No hope heroes cover the page with depts in hell
And fingers in blood
Poor little bodies all covered in scabs threw it all away
Another life in the grave
Another life in the grave

Life is like a broken arrow-memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune-
Well I could make you happy every goddamn single day of your life

Making my love like a shining star
Like a shining star
Baby that's what you are
Like a shining star

Making my love like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far"
Rock,"Ain't seen a night, things work out right, go by.
Things on my mind, and I just don't have the time, and it don't seem right.
Ain't seen a day, that I don't hear people say, they know they're gonna' die.
This may seem a little bit crazy, but I don't think you should be so lazy.
If you think you've heard this before, well, stick around I'm gonna' tell you more.


One just like the other, sin's a good man's brother, but is that right?
You tell me that I don't, then I say I won't, but then I might.
You said this is the way it's supposed to be, but it just don't seem right to me, and that's outta' sight.
Some folks need an education, don't give up, or we'll loose the nation.
You say we need a revolution? It seems to be the only solution.

Rock,"When I wake up
When I walk the streets
I´ve spent all of my time just trying to be free

A fashion accessory in musical form
It´s stuck in my brain
It´s driving me insane

There´s something in my head that I just can´t get rid
of

Catchy Chorus
Came to bother us
Brand new masterpiece written by a young genius
The spokesman of our generation
And the symbol of the end of my patience

No more, it´s enough
Would you mind if I shut if off?

No no no no no no
I don´t wanna listen to that song again
No no no no no
I don´t wanna listen to that song again

When I´m in the shower
When I walk the streets
I´ve spent all of my time just trying to be free
A fashion accessory in musical form
It´s stuck in my brain
It´s driving me insane
There´s something in my head that I just can´t get rid
of

Catchy Chorus

Rock,"Blue sky when you gonna learn to rain?
And let yourself go blue for once
And let go of the weight you've been carrying
In this house, no one goes to sleep for days,
Its like were working on a mountainside
Trying not to slide,
Into the ocean,

I can take care of you
But only if you want
Im strong enough to carry you

Across the icy lake, across the icy lake
But I cant fight your blues,
Cause I know I'll lose
What's left of my mind
I cant win,
But for you I will try
My baby blue

My mountain is hidden in a pile of trees
And shes the one I'll have to climb,
If I ever wanna see,
Blue sky
When you gonna learn to rain?
And let yourself go blue for once
And let go of that pain?

I can take care of you
The way you'd like to feel
Underneath the riverbed

Across the icy lake, across the icy lake
I cant fight your blues
Cause I know I'll lose
What's left of my mind
I cant win,
But for you I will try
For you
For you
My baby blue"

Rock,"Well the sun is surely sinking down,
but the moon is slowly rising.
So this old world must still be spinning around,
I still love you.

So close your eyes,
you can close your eyes,
it's all right.
I don't know no love songs,
I can't sing the blues anymore.
I can sing this song a
nd you can sing this song
when I'm gone.

It won't be long before another day,
we gonna have a good time.
No one's gonna take that time away.
You can stay as long as you like.

So close your eyes,
you can close your eyes,
It's all right.
I don't know no love songs
I can't sing the blues anymore.
But I can sing this song
and you can sing this song
when I'm gone."
Rock,"Yeah the rain came
I said hey buddy
Buddy the streets are a snake skin
I belong out there walkin'
Nobody's stoppin' to bother me
They hide
Outside, the ceiling's cryin

Listen to the sound
Of the gutters runnin'
Wash this dirty town
All fronts and no backs
Give me my time
Let me be outside
Under the ceiling

Cryin'
Yeah, all over me
Cryin'
Yeah, all over me
Outside you know

I listen to the sounds

None of his tempting charms.
Cheat you at your Jesus now
And roll you in his arms.

I said yes, sign of judgement, yes

I don't like old satan,
Nothing he say or do.
Tell one lie to hurt us all,
Then two to make it true.

Rock,"Somewhere out in the back of your mind (somewhere)
comes your real life and the life that you know
It seems like it was the creation of some of those same old things
It seemed to be the only thing left out in the light

She had trusted many...
But been unfamiliar with...
Almost everyone but you

Well maybe I'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire
Everytime that you walk in the room
Well there is magic all around you, if I do say so myself..
I have known this much longer than I've known you

She had trusted many..
And then there would be someone who would enter into her presence
That she could sense for miles..
She dreamed of her wanton luxury
And she laughed and she cried..and she tried to taunt him
and he hated to be separated..
from that picture..No...

Well maybe I'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire
everytime that you walk in the room
ooh, well there is magic all around you, if i do say so myself...
Well i have known this much longer than I've known you

long nets of white cloud my memory..
long nest of white cloud my memory..
ohh..there is magic.. all around you..
everytime you walk in the room

Well maybe i'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire
everytime that you walk in the room
well there is magic all around you, if i do say so myself..
well i have known this much longer than i've known you..

Rock,"We met out on open streets
When we had no place to go
I remember how my heart beat
When you said ""I love you so""
Then little by little
We choked out all the life that out love could hold
No, no

It was like we held a noose
And baby without check
We pulled it a little tighter around our necks
Each one waiting for the other
Darling to say when
Now baby you can leave me tonight on the loose end

We didn't count tomorrows
We took what we had and baby we ran
There was no place for sorrow
Every place we went I held your hand
And when the night closed in
I was sure your kisses told me all I had to know
But oh no

It was like we held a noose
and baby without check
we pulled 'til it grew tighter around our necks
each one waiting for the other
darling to say when
oh baby you can leave me tonight on the loose end

Our love has fallen around us
Like we said it never would
We saw it happen to all the others
But to us it never would
Well how could something so bad, darling
Come from something that was so good
I don't know

But it was like we held a noose
And baby without check
we pulled 'til it grew tighter around our necks
each one waiting for the other
darling to say when
oh baby you can leave me tonight on the loose end

On a loose end
"
Pop,"If I am right
If I can be
Constant and faithful
You'll find me

In my devotion
In my devotion

What if you find a fault
Between my purpose and my deeds
And deem me beyond salvation
Judge me to be unworthy

Of your devotion
Of your devotion

If this be obsession deliver me
A passing infatuation deliver me
A feeling lacking in purity deliver me
A test of fidelity deliver me
Deliver me
Deliver me

What if I should find
You're no good for me
What if I can't be strong enough
What if I can't break free

Of my devotion
Of my devotion"
Rock,"I got no time for the corner boys
Down in the street making all that noise
don't want no whores on 8th avenue
`Cause tonight I wanna be with you
Tonight I'm gonna take that ride
Across the river to the Jersey side
Take my baby to the carnival
And I'll take her on all the rides

`Cause down the shore everything's all right
You and your baby on a Saturday night
You know all my dreams come true
When I'm walking down the street with you

Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la I'm in love with a Jersey girl

You know she thrills me with all her charms
When I'm wrapped up in my baby's arms
My little girl gives me everything
I know that some day she'll wear my ring
So don't bother me, man! I ain't got no time
I'm on my way to see that girl of mine
`Cause nothing matters in this whole wide world
When you're in love with a Jersey girl

Sha la la la...

I see you on the street and you look so tired
I know that job you got leaves you so uninspired
When I come by to take you out to eat
You're lyin' all dressed up on the bed,baby,fast asleep
Go in the bathroom and put your makeup on
We're gonna take that little brat of yours and drop her off at your mom's
I know a place where the dancing's free
Now baby won't you come with me
`Cause down the shore everything's all right
You and your baby on a Saturday night
Nothing matters in this whole wide world
When you're in love with a Jersey girl"
Rock,"Well I was waiting around
for somebody to die
Nobody did but a part of me died
I suppose from all that waiting
These things they pass in time
But the moment gets real
and it's hard sometimes
I think of somewhere
where I'd like to be
And I hold that in my mind
But there's always tonight
Tonight

And you, you make me feel
like I'm here when I'm not
And it, it makes me feel
like I'm not here
You, you make me feel
like I'm not here

But I am, I am
More than you think I am

Take a picture of your life
for a second now
Freeze it
Look at the screen

What parts of you were daydreams
Illusions, and other things?
These things they pass in time
But the moment's so real
and it's hard sometimes
Keep the faith,
keep moving in time
To the music in your mind

And when you stay home tonight
It can become your home

And you, you make me feel
like I'm here when I'm not
And it, it makes me feel
like I'm not here
You, you make me feel
like I'm not here

And I am
I am
More than you think I am
I am
I am
More than you think I am

You make me feel
like a natural ghost
You make me feel
like a natural ghost
You make me feel
like a natural ghost
You make me feel
like a natural ghost"
Rock,"Don't hide your face, what you were before
It doesn't have to be you anymore
Maybe you've been scared and that's what you know
And all the shame gonna call you home
It's gonna call you home

Never was your fault but still a part to play
You carry it so close you can read its name
In a lot of ways you're still that lost kid
Yeah, You can still survive but not exactly live
No, not exactly live

Gonna stand this ground
Gonna say it loud
Never define yourself
By choices others make

If no one said it yet
It would be a shame
That ends right now
You're not alone in pain
Never alone in pain

Never alone in pain
Never alone in pain
Never alone in pain"
Rock,"Thought I saw a lady I knew some time before
But I was only dreaming, what's it for?

Thought I was a preacher, speaking to the floor
But I was only dreaming, what's the score?

I was only dreaming, what's it for?
I was only dreaming, what's the score?

Thought I was a robber, standing at my door
Turns out to be a lady from before

I was only dreaming, what's the score?
Was only dreaming, what's it for?

I'm lying in the rain

Pop,"You know it's hard to be your friend
I hate to let you down again
We don't know how it's gonna end
Cause now you know the secret
I can't never mend

Cause this could be gone when we wake up, tomorrow
Hearts are unchanged
Time that is left, is borrowed
And I can't take the way that you look at me
Is there any place you and I could be?
And we could go away
It all could go away

This silence is deafening
This ocean is without an end
And there's something I know
Something I know, we were meant to be
Please listen to me, are you listening?

Cause this could be gone when we wake up, tomorrow
Hearts are unchanged
Time that is left, is borrowed

Rock,"From in the shadow she calls
and in the shadows she finds a way
and in the shadow she crawls
Clutching her faded photograph, my image under her thumb
Yes with a message for my heart
Yes with a message for my heart

She's been everybody else's girl, maybe one day she'll be her own
Everybody else's girl, maybe one day she'll be her own

And in the doorway they stay
and laugh as violins fill with water
Screams from the bluebells can't make them go away
Well I'm not seventeen but I've cuts on my knees
Falling down as the winter takes one more cherry tree

She's been everybody else's girl, maybe one day she'll be her own
Everybody else's girl, maybe one day she'll be her own

Everyone else's girl maybe one day she'll be her own
Rushin' rivers thread so thin limitation
Everyone else's girl maybe one day she'll be her own
Dreams with the flying pigs turbid blue and the drugstores too safe
in their coats and in their do's yeah
Everyone else's girl maybe one day
maybe one day one day she'll be her own

And in the mist there she rides
and castles are burning in my heart
and as I twist I hold tight
and I ride to work every morning wondering why
""Sit in the chair and be good now""
and become all that they told you
The white coats enter her room
and I'm callin' my baby, callin' my baby, callin' my baby, callin'
Everybody else's girl, maybe one day she'll be her own

Rock,"(Foster, Jordan)

something told me it was over
when I saw you and him talking
something deep down in my soul said, cry boy
when I saw you and him out walking
I would rather, I would rather go blind girl
than to see you walk away from me child

so you see I love you so much
I don't want to see you leave me baby
most of all I just don't, I just don't want to be free
I was just, I was just sitting here thinking
of your kiss and your warm embrace child
when the reflection in the glass
that I been held to my lips now baby
revealed the tears I had on my face
I would rather, I would rather be blind child
than to see you walk away from me
baby, baby, baby I would rather go blind

Rock,"come on now the curtain is drawn
and tomorrow stands before you
dressed and draped in a cold black cape
like a crow he ignores you

look again there's a beautiful girl
covers sin in a holy land shroud
it's the great disappearing act
done again for the marveled crowd

as we're chasing our tails
and biting our nails
so strong and frail

and we build and tear it down
with barely the time to say
how did it get so late
i'll never know

step outside and now the doors open wide
and the minions are eager to find him
put a million miles under your heals
and you're still behind him
cover your clocks with your chains and your locks
while the seasons get hotter and colder

stretch your faces and lie about your ages
and still you're going to get older

as we're chasing our tails
and biting our nails
so strong and frail

and we build and tear it down
with barely the time to say
how did it get so late
i'll never know

hang on till your fingers break
and your hands unwind
he will escape you every time
from under your pillows
through open windows
and out on the rails

and we build and tear it down
with barely the time to say
how did it get so late
i'll never know"
Rock,"Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

Backbeat the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk along are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me?
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now

And all the roads that lead to you were winding
And all the lights that light the way were blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me?
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me?
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me"
Pop,"Everybody's looking at me
But it's alright, I like attention
The club's not hot until I walk through
They stop and stare and watch me move

Like ""Damn, I like that""
I'm sexy and you know it clap your hands
Oh, it's like that
I'm not afraid to show it, understand?
Yeah, I'm hot, bitch
Don't be mad at me go check your man

[Bridge:]
Girls and boys are looking at me
I can't blame 'em 'cause I'm sexy, ow!

[Chorus:]
Don't care who's watching me
I do just what I want
Just 'cause I dance with you
Don't mean you're getting some
Don't get excited baby
'Cause I might turn you on
Turn you on, turn you out
Give 'em something to write about

All the boys are looking up at me
As I dance on the table top
Tonight I'll be their liquid dreams
They want a piece of what I got

Damn I like that
She's sexy and she's shaking over me
Oh, it's like that
She's hot and I can't take her I need a drink
I'm hot yeah
She's cooler than I ever thought she'd be

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Don't dance too close, I might turn you on
Don’t try to impress me, my papers no
Don’t believe all that you read my ish out loud
We can dance all night but you ain’t getting none, none
Sorry I turned you on
Take a cold shower when you get home

[Bridge]

[Chorus]"
Pop,"I met this shy boy, cute as hell
and grabbed him by the hand
He pulled me back, I asked what's wrong, he said
Oh, I can't dance
I said: That's fine, just keep in time
and show off what you got
If you mess up, boy, I won't mind
as long as you don't stop
Woah, na na, don't stop
Oh, na na, don't stop

Even if you can't dance, just hold my hips
Hold my hands while I roll my hips
Even if you can't dance, I'll handle it
Follow me and don't stop
Even if you can't dance, don't stand and watch
Stand and watch while I make it hot
Even if you can't dance, I'ma make it hot
Follow me and don't stop
Oh, na na, don't stop
Oh, na na, don't stop

Keep your eyes on me (woo!)
Singing I'ma teach you a lesson
You just gotta move in my direction
Keep your eyes on me
Being all anxious ain't an option
Baby, I ain't got no plans of stopping
No, na na, don't stop
Oh, na na, don't stop

Even if you can't dance, just hold my hips (woo, hey!)
Hold my hands while I roll my hips

Rock,"Explosive Situation
I got no explanation
Love has shout out of the blue - hitting me, and you
It isn't just attraction
It's more a chain reaction
Our love is no ricochet - won't go astray

I can't light the fuse and then retire
Love's got me in it's line of fire

Oo baby you're dynamite
There's never been another love so exciting
Oo baby it's dynamite
You've got the power of thunder and lightning-
You're dynamite

Your lips are so inviting
My senses are igniting
I know our love is here to stay - won't go away
It's bigger by the hour
Loves overwhelming power
Is moving irresistably - through you and me

I can't light the fuse and then retire
Love's got me in it's line of fire

Oo baby you're dynamite
There's never been another love so exciting
Oo baby it's dynamite
You've got the power of thunder and lightning-
You're dynamite

I can't light the fuse and then retire

Rock,"Just when we think we conquered it
It seems we lose the fight again
But there's just no stoppin' it
It's like a bad dream that never ends
It puts up walls between us
That get harder, and harder, and harder, and harder, and harder
To remove
But we let it continue, like people in love always do
Ooh - Ooh
Ooh - Ooh
Ooh - Ooh

Lets not pretend that we're unique
Coz everybody's tasted loves illusion
We try to hide the fact that we
Got lost between the choas and confusion
And the love we feel
Is gettin' deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and deeper
By the minute

But we let it slip away
Coz we don't know a good thing while we're in it

Ooh - Ooh
Ooh - Ooh
Ooh - Ooh

""Y el amor que sentimos es mas profundo""
""The love that we feel is deeper"")

Something that I been thinking about for such a long time,
I just gotta let it out,
Oh, you know the other night,
Hhmm, as I lay sleeping baby,
I dreamed I held you in my arms,
When I woke up, I found I was mistaken,
Do you know that I hung my head and I cried,
That you are my sunshine, baby,
I really do believe you are my only sunshine, yeah,
You make me happy,
You make me happy,
You make me happy when my skies are grey,
You'll never know dear how much I love ya,
So go on and change my grey skies to blue,
Change my grey skies loving you, yeah, all right,
Just a little bit a softer,

So much time is wasted in confusion

Never see again in this world
The one I was I will never be again

But I won't wait for you to believe me

I won't wait for heaven to receive me
I will pray, I will say

Rock,"Bobby's got a gun that he keeps beneath his pillow (oh yeah)
Out on the streets your chances are zero (oh yeah)

It ain't too complicated
You're messin' with Murder Incorporated

Now you check over your shoulder everywhere that you go (oh yeah)
Walkin down the streets, there's eyes in every shadow (oh yeah)
You better take a look around you (come on down)
That equipment you got's so outdated
You can't compete with Murder Incorporated
Everywhere you look now there's Murder Incorporated

So you keep a little secret down deep inside your dresser drawer
From dealing with the heat you're feelin' down on the killin' floor
No matter where you step you feel you're never out of danger
So complicated you keep complaining some bones hurtin'
I hear that you, you got dogged downtown, man it leaves your head cold (oh
yea)
And everywhere you look life ain't got no soul (oh yeah)

That apartment you live in feels like it's just a place to hide
When your walkin' down the streets you won't need nowhere there to hide
Now the cops reported you as just another homicide
I could tell that you was just frustrated from livin' with Murder
Incorporated

Incorporated
Everywhere you look now
Murder Incorporated
Down on your knees
Murder
Everywhere that you turn it's murder
Murder
Everywhere you look there's murder.

Rock,"I'm Only Sleeping


When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float upstream

Please don't wake me
No don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping

Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need

Please don't spoil my day
I'm miles away
And after all
I'm only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for that sleepy feeling

Please don't spoil my day
I'm miles away
And after all
I'm only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float upstream

Happen and pass, leaving me the same
Of course it must be something else
Leading questions I might ask myself

Sure and certain
Wander 'til we're old
Lost and lurking
Wonder 'til we're cold

What you do works for a time
Until you drop without a warning sign
If you keep going on like this
I'll be one more thing for you to miss

Sure and certain
Wander 'til we're old
Lost and lurking
Wonder 'til we're cold

But I call you Stormy today
All of a sudden that ol' rain is fallin' down
And my world is cloudy and gray
You've gone away

Old Stormy Stormy
Old Stormy Stormy
Old Stormy Stormy
Old Stormy Stormy

Yesterday's love was alive, the warm summer breeze
But like the weather you changed
Now things are dreary, baby, windy and cold
And I stand alone in the rain
Callin' out your name

Stormy Stormy
Come back to me Stormy
Stormy Stormy

Bring back that sunny day

Stormy, come back to me Stormy


Come on home! Stormy

That your life is a wasting
Happiness beyond your reach
Sweet love has gone astray
Suddenly itâ€™s bitter


Hard times
Hard times


When youâ€™re all alone
Nothing seems to matter
Sadness always fills the air
Hurts so deep inside
You just have to cry out
Wow.....hard times
Wow.....hard times
Wow.....hard times
Wow.....hard times


Give yourself a chance
You have something special
That nobody else can claim
Deep inside your heart
Shines a revelation
Wow.....shine on

Rock,"When you're growing up in a small town
when you're growing up in a small town
when you're growing up in a small town
you say, no one famous ever came from here

When you're growing up in a small town
and you're having a nervous breakdown
and you think that you'll never escape it
yourself or the place that you live

Where did Picasso come from
there's no Michelangelo coming from Pittsburgh
if art is the tip of the iceberg
I'm the part sinking below

When you're growing up in a small town
bad skin, bad eyes, gay and fatty
people look at you funny
when you're in a small town

My father worked in construction
it's not something for which I'm suited
oh, what is something for which you are suited
getting out of here

I hate being odd in a small town
if they stare let them stare in New York City
as this pink eyed painting albino
how far can my fantasy go

I'm no Dali coming from Pittsburgh
no adorable lisping Capote
my hero, oh, do you think I could meet him
I'd camp out at his front door

There is only one good thing about small town
there is only one good use for a small town
there is only one good thing about small town
you know that you want to get out

When you're growing up in a small town
you know you'll grow down in a small town
there is only one good use for a small town

You hate it and you'll know you have to leave

Rock,"It's gonna be another hard night
You wanna take it all alone
You wanna face up to the trouble
You wanna face up to your soul

Sometimes it gets a little crazy somewhere down inside

Chorus
But you can still change your mind
You can change your feelings

Everybody wants all the world can give 'em
Everybody wants to get all they can get
Everybody's waiting on somethin' that hasn't come yet
And you can hide it for a little while honey
You can try and just lose it for awhile
Then it's gonna do something to ya somewhere down inside

(Repeat 1st Chorus)

Oh and it gets harder by the minute girl
Oh it gets harder every day
Listen to me darlin', oh you don't have to wait

It's alright, you can still change your mind
Just hold tight, everything's gonna be alright
If you can change your mind
You can change your feeling"

It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky

And no religion too

Imagine all the people
Living life in peace
You may say,
I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day
You'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions

No need for greed or hunger

Blink twice and you're in for the race

Escalator moving too fast for me

You won't ever bring me to my knees
Won't give in

Clinging on for dear life

Is it enough?
Tell me is it enough?
When you ask yourself the question
Can you feel it in your bones?
Is it enough? oh ooh

I don't wanna get political
But when we all pull together we don't fall
Would it be so terrible
If we all held each other
So much more than we do?
Am I getting through to you?
Will you break the chain?

Take a minute to consider it
Let go of all we're convinced we need
Together we can make more of this
Together we can do more
To walk the same direction
Form a real connection along the way

With all these good intentions
Something's still not right
I've been drowning in possessions
Clinging on for dear life

Is it enough?
Tell me is it enough?
When you ask yourself the question
Do you feel it in your bones?
Is it enough? oh ooh

When you ask yourself the question
Do you feel it in your bones?
Are you holding on to something
You're afraid of letting go?
Is it enough?
Tell me is it enough? oh ooh
When you ask yourself the question
Do you feel it in your bones?

Rock,"This church is a mess, jackets and crutches
Clutch pearls and buckets of ice
Dyed cotton candy, blonde lady does the honours
In a deuce in all the family who fights

And the sunlight of late afternoon
Leans across the altar till it slaps the groom
The flowers we gathered in ribbons of blue
Clutched tight to her chest in her room

And the band played Christ Is Risen Today
While everybody waits

'Cause nobody knows who they really are
To the stranded in Coronado trashed at the bar
Till the wind carries all of the things you love most
Long loose strings tangled in the trees

Woman, your silence brought me on my knees
Where I needed to be

Your hair smells of lilac, roses and cinnamon
And waves moving slow across the rocks
Humid and heavy, clouds of salt water
Rusted the hands off the clocks

And I smoke cigarettes in the heat
Watching Flamingos from the hotel balcony
My head was on fire and the bartenders knew
Written on the wall, in cursive, ""We're through. ""

And the band played The Safety Dance as I cried
In the taxi alone

'Cause nobody knows that they are the fool
Stranded in Coronado, drunk at the pool
'Till the drinks carries off the burden at cost
To let go of things you already lost

Woman, your silence brought me on my knees
Where I needed to be
Woman, your silence brought me to my knees
Where I needed to be

The highway was empty, we speeded on safely
Tears falling onto your dress
The ring on your finger disappeared slowly
You let go already's my guess

You cried as we made our way home
Said you didn't wanna leave
But I could tell by the things that your ma and your pa didn't do
Like look me in the eye as we said goodbye

And the band says Wednesday's my right hand
As I pray for you at night

'Cause nobody knows what they really want
Till the car's full of boxes and you watch it drive off
The cocaine and pills and the drinks, they were off
And the cigarettes, they just make you cough

Oh, woman, your love brought me on my knees
Where I needed to be

The house is so quiet
I hear the leaves fall from the lemon trees where
There's now too much room for this house made for two
Your side of the closet's so bare

I still hear the sound of your voice
Calling my name like some midnight train
Rumbling heart full of ghosts
Of everyone that I loved, I miss you the most

And the plans that we made fade like the sun on the coast

'Cause nobody knows what they really need
Till it's too late with reason to wait
You wake up insane, screaming her name
But there's no one to blame now but me

Oh, woman, your silence brought me on my knees
Where I needed to be
Oh, woman, your silence brought me on my knees
Where I needed to be"
Rock,"(scream) I just gotta get away
Canâ€™t stand it
Children suffer every day


Tell me baby
Whatâ€™s it for
Fighting daily
For the turf


Weâ€™re still killing each other
In the name of the Lord
Thereâ€™s a brand new graffiti
With blood on the walls


Peace... are you that far away?


Now you can feel it
Other peopleâ€™s pain
Love can heal it
Gentle as the rain


Oh, the United Nations drag their feet on the floor
All they do is spend your money
They donâ€™t tell you what for


Peace... what price we have to pay
Peace... thereâ€™s gotta be a better way


People tell me itâ€™s useless to look for a way
I believe that tomorrow starts right here, today


Peace... are you that far away
Peace... thereâ€™s gotta be a better way


Peace... are you that far away
Peace... thereâ€™s gotta be a better way
Peace, peace
Thereâ€™s gotta be a better way"
Rock,"Got a royal flush
I got a ten bob in my pocket for luck
Just another crush
I got my head read in the shed once again, my friend

Inside, outside, upside, downside,
See my face, wanna take me home
I missed your sister,
Shake your pistol,
Hear my voice on your telephone

Just another lush
I got my ten green bottles in my pocket for luck
And another ruck
Get your dead head in the shed once again, my friend

Inside, outside, upside, downside,
See my face, wanna take me home
I missed your sister,
Shake your pistol,
Hear my voice on your telephone

Inside, outside, upside, downside,
See my face, wanna take me home
I missed your sister,
Shake your pistol,
Hear my voice on your telephone

Cigarette burn
Got another for me?
Dirty magazine
Tell me what you have seen

You're sleeping on a shag pile,
Sleeping on me,
Sleeping like an angel watching over me,

Rock,"African nightmare one-time Mormon
More men fall in Hullabaloo men
I slide to the nearest bar
Undermine chairman I went too far
Bent on a windfall rent a sony
Wonder how the dollar went down
Gotta get a word to Elizabeth's father
Hey no, he wished me well

Seemed like another day
I could fly into the eye of God on high

His burning eye will see me through
(One of these days, one of these days got get work through one of these days)
His burning eye will see me through

Pushing my luck, gonna fly like a mad thing
Bare strip takeoff skimming over Rhino
Born in slumber less than peace
Struggle with a child whose screaming dreaming
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine
Sick of you, sick of me
Lust for the free life
Quashed and maimed
Like a valuable loved one
Left unnamed

Seemed like another day
I could fly into the eye of God on high
Seemed like another day
I could fly into the eye of God on high

Over the bushland over the trees
Wise like Orangutan that was me

His burning eye will see me through

Pop,"I'm bored, it's hot
Let's play a little game of ready or not
Gas up, drive through
Pick us up a margarita or two

Two lanes no phone
No time I gotta get back home

You know I know
You wanna know
No need to fight

It'd be a crying shame
To waste this night

Run with me honey
I'll take you on down to where I'm from
Come with me honey
Where everything's sacred and nothing gets done
We got a whole town full of saints and sinners
Late to rise and early for dinner
Either way the sun's gonna come
So baby let's run

Be bad be good
Wait 'til you see what's under this hood
It's fast it's strong
Brace yourself you better hold on

You drive I'll ride
Take you cross the river to the other side
Round here we don't fool around
Ain't no moon tonight for slowin' down

Run with me honey
I'll take you on down to where I'm from
Come with me honey
Where everything's sacred and nothing gets done
We got a whole town full of saints and sinners
Late to rise and early for dinner
Either way the sun's gonna come
So baby let's run

Run with me honey
Run with me honey
Run with me honey
Run with me honey
You ain't got nothin' better to do than

Run with me honey
I'll take you on down to where I'm from
Come with me honey
Where everything's sacred and nothing gets done
We got a whole town full of saints and sinners
Late to rise and early for dinner
Either way the sun's gonna come

Don't you know that you could be the one

So baby let's run
You know you wanna run
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Run
MM, mm
You know you wanna run"
Pop,"Chorus:
I'm caught up in the middle
Jumping through the riddle
I'm falling just a little tonight (uh uh uh)
Cos everybody's making trouble
Someone's burst their bubble
But we'll be getting by alright (uh uh uh)

Chorus:
I'm caught up in the middle
Jumping through the riddle
I'm falling just a little tonight (uh uh uh)

Sooner or later this drunken elevator
Is gonna stop where I'm supposed to be
It's ten past eleven, I'm half way up to heaven
But I'm stuck in reality

Night's kind of funny
Not in it for the money
But I know that I've gotta pay
Love's gonna getcha
But only when I letcha
And I don't wanna turn away

Why can't the boys be the toys
That the girls want the boys to be
And why can't the girls see the world
That the boys want the girls to see, yeah

Chorus:
I'm caught up in the middle
Jumping through the riddle
I'm falling just a little tonight (uh uh uh)
Cos everybody's making trouble
Someone's burst their bubble
But we'll be getting by alright (uh uh uh)

At night it's on the low
No front just sing the flow
We're speaking all in code
To get to the place we know
Sweat running down my back
I'm wearing leather, black
Falling into a trap
There is no turning back

I got my ladies with me
Fellas get cool and freaky
But we've gotta keep him tame
Cos we don't wanna play that game

Everybody from the block
Needs to be feeling nice
It ain't no weakest party
But get up enjoy the ride
What you see and what you hear
Can never be exposed
Acting out of character
Is everything we know

Chorus:
I'm caught up in the middle
Jumping through the riddle
I'm falling just a little tonight (uh uh uh)
Cos everybody's making trouble
Someone's burst their bubble
But we'll be getting by alright (uh uh uh)

I'm caught up in the middle
Jumping through the riddle
I'm falling just a little tonight (uh uh uh)
Cos everybody's making trouble
Someone's burst their bubble
But we'll be getting by alright (uh uh uh)

I know it's kind of tender
My body's tired
It's freaky but I'm ready for this bumpy ride
Everybody's tripping
It's all insane
But the voices in my head are saying it's ok

Trying to slow it down or
It's against the rush
Gotta keep it cool to avoid the crush
I dream that I......... and it's starting to show
That I've moved it on
Cos I've changed the flow

Chorus:
I'm caught up in the middle
Jumping through the riddle
I'm falling just a little tonight (uh uh uh)

Someone's burst their bubble

Pop,"Girl, there's more to love than meets the eye,
girl, there's more to what I feel inside.
And if I told you, would you be my girl, for you I'd travel round the world.
Time is on our side, girl, you're my one true love, girl,
we've come too far to ever be just friends.
Time is on our side, girl, let's show the whole world,
love is the answer and time is our closest friend.

If I sent you flowers, would you walk away,
or would it be enough to make you stay?
Even though we're young, girl, one thing's for sure,
in time our love will endure.
Time is ...

Babe, what would you say, time brings us closer every day.
Time is ..."
Pop,"Greetings. You're about to listen to Operation: Wake Up by Mike Posner

This album was written, recorded, and produced over a period of two weeks in Detroit, Michigan in my parents' basement

It's meant to be listened to all the way through. At least on the first listen. And it's about 36 minutes long

If you can't devote 36 minutes of undivided attention to this album, I again politely ask that you turn it off and return at a later time

I love you and I thank you for taking the time to listen in the first place

Also, it's important to note that the characters and the stories in this album are completely fictional. In addition, anyone struggling with a mental illness - depression, schizophrenia - should not listen to this album. Turn it off

With caution, tact and perspective, enjoy Operation: Wake Up

Pop,"Lately shit's been driving me crazy
Won't you take me outta this city
Streets too busy
Men too old and the girls too pretty

I see that you want me
I'm needing somebody
Don't ask me no questions
There's really no reason
You look like your ready
To run from the city
I'm feelin the same way
Just wanna get away

Met you on the corner of my favorite shop
I don't really care if I know you or not
All I really need, someone to hold me tonight
Doesn't make a difference if its wrong or its right
Maybe in a day of two I'm falling for you
And you'll be gone and I'll be painting pictures of you
But for now all that matters is the thing that we've got
See I don't really care if we make it or not

Lately shit's been driving me crazy
Won't you take me outta this city
Streets too busy
Men too old and the girls too pretty
Baby won't you come and save me
Won't you make my world less chilly
Don't need pitty
Just your arms around my body

Won't you come and take me
Away from the city
Let's do it today
Just want to get away

Met you on the corner of my favorite shop
I don't really care if I know you or not
All I really need, someone to hold me tonight
Doesn't make a difference if its wrong or its right
Maybe in a day of two I'm falling for you
And you'll be gone and I'll be painting pictures of you
But for now all that matters is the thing that we've got
See I don't really care if we make it or not

Lately shit's been driving me crazy
Won't you take me outta this city
Streets too busy
Men too old and the girls too pretty
Baby won't you come and save me
Won't you make my world less chilly
Don't need pitty
Just your arms around my body

Let's just do something else

Met you on the corner of my favorite shop
I don't really care if I know you or not
All I really need, someone to hold me tonight
Doesn't make a difference if its wrong or its right
Maybe in a day of two I'm falling for you
And you'll be gone and I'll be painting pictures of you
But for now all that matters is the thing that we've got

Just your arms around my body

Can you do that for me...

Rock,"(Joe Jackson)

Here we go, Monday morning at last
In the land of the brave and the bold
Sunlight is hurting my eyes
But it's on to the glittering prize
There's a rent to pay
Gimme a coffee to go, make it fast
There'll be a merger before it gets cold
They've closed down the whole seventh floor
The young guns are ready for war
But I'm holding on

Long ago and far away
I was safe and sound
But love got lost
Along the way

Saturday night, went to see La BohÃªme *
Used the spare ticket just for my coat
I guess I should swallow my pride
But I'd be damned if I'd hawk it outside
In the pouring rain

promo card sleeve
r. 19 October 2000
Monday morning and no-one to blame
Keep hitting icebergs but I'm still afloat
But I'd like a new body and face
But I'd settle for a friend with a space
On their calendar

Hard to know and hard to say
Wonder what I've found
But love got lost
Along the way

Here comes Mr. Worldly and Wise
If he touches me again I'll scream
I can't stand his sensitive eyes
Like I'm some dying diva to him
Touch me ... don't touch me ...
Touch me ... don't touch me ... don't touch me ...

Long ago and far away
I was safe and sound
But love got lost
Along the way

And everything you've dreamed of

Yeah I'm the broken hearted fool
Who was never quite enough

I'm an insider, I been burned by the fire
And I've had to live with some hard promises
I've crawled through the briars -- I'm an insider

It's a hall of strangers
It's a cage without a key
You can feel the danger
And I'm the one who oughta know
I'm the one you couldn't trust
Yeah I'm the lonely silent one
I'm the one left in the dust

I'll bet you're his self-control
Yeah you'll become his legacy

Not one of your twisted friends
I'm the one you couldn't love

Pop,"Always sitting pretty with my legs closed, know just how to get up out of limos
If I gotta walk then I gotta mean walk, if you wanna talk politics lets talk
Go by the book, and stick to the plan, never see me looking at another man
It's no fun when it's all correct, don't know why I've got my mind in check

Forget what you've heard, about the good girl, that's not what I'm about...

I wanna drive too fast, I wanna play full blast, I wanna dance till I drop,
I wanna rock, full stop
I wanna roll too high, I wanna ride or die, I wanna live life hard knock.
I wanna rock, full stop

Always call when I'm running a little late, Got my money put away in an estate
Never complain about how I feel, always down and keeping it real
Always listen to my friends good advice, never once gambled and I never roll the dice,
Always care about the do's and dont's, cause I didn't want to disappoint

Forget what you've heard, about the good girl, that's not what I'm about...

I wanna drive too fast, I wanna play full blast, I wanna dance till I drop,
I wanna rock, full stop
I wanna roll too high, I wanna ride or die, I wanna live life hard knock.
I wanna rock, full stop


Rap - I wanna drive at 105 in the Lex ride, and over-take haterz who ride in the X5 , I wanna play music so loud - right, the whole crowd will hold their ears and go - oww.
I wanna dance till I drop or docs tell me to stop, or die to the sounds of rock and hip-hop
So many things to do, it's a myriad, I wanna do whatever i want, period


I wanna drive too fast, I wanna play full blast, I wanna dance till I drop,
I wanna rock, full stop
I wanna roll too high, I wanna ride or die, I wanna live life hard knock.
I wanna rock, full stop"

How each of us came here?
Do you realize at this time now
That you can do a lot more than you think?
I know it's hard to understand
We not always have a plan
But I have to confess
I was so scared
(But now I see that I...)

Discovered new worlds
I made new ones
And together we had the strength to move on
I changed in many ways
The music was the basis
If I could turn back time frame by frame
I wish I could live it all over again

Do you still keep in your mind
All those who fell by the wayside?
Do you realize now that a bother
Can make you go much further?
I know it's hard to understand
But sometimes we have to take a chance
And now I confess
I've nothing to dread
('Cuz I realize that I...)

Discovered new worlds
I made new ones
And together we had the strength to move on
I changed in many ways
The music was the basis
If I could turn back time frame by frame
I wish I could live it all over again

So many moments
So many friends
Many fights and many laughs
So many drooping tears
So that's how it all ends?
What will happen now?
The only thing I can think is that
I'll miss you all

Discovered new worlds
I made new ones
And together we had the strength to move on
I changed in many ways
The music was the basis
If I could turn back time frame by frame
I wish I could live it all over again"

Thieves and muggers
tricks and hustlers
cheats and traitors
scum and low-lives

Rest your weary heads, all is well

You won't be sad or broken tonight
you won't be squealed on, ripped up tonight
you won't be back-stabbed, double cross, face down
teeth knocked out, lying in a gutter somewhere
So dream on

Freaks and junkies
fakes and phonies
drunks and cowards
manic preachers

Rest your weary heads, all is well

You won't be pushed down or messed with tonight
you won't be lied to, ruffed up tonight
You won't be insane, paranoid, obsessed
aimlessly wandering through the dark night

It’s not me that you’re thinking of
You forget what we’ve found together
You forget what we’ve found is love

The light in your eyes has faded
And your voice has another tone
I have cried all my tears already
Once again I am all alone
I got something I want to tell you
I got something I want to say"
Rock,"Five million guys have tried to reduce her,
To another girl out in the street.
All those pretty eyes, have lied to seduce her,
But they come crawlin' back at her feet.

Just like the times I've been deceived.
The touch of her starlight makes me happy,
I can see her shinin' through in my dreams.


And I wake up cryin' ...

And let me play the game on another day.

kicking a hole in that door
Hey, Ace will you take a look at this place
and get those neighbors out of the hall
I'm declaring martial law

I came, I saw, I declared martial law
'cause I'm the marshall in the city
And if you stand away, I've got something to say
that I might even help you
Keep your hands to yourself and keep your big mouth shut
don't you touch nobody with hate-hate-hate-hate
And if all you've got is poison in your mouth
make sure that you don't speak
It's 3:30 in the early morning
don't punch, don't scratch, don't bite
Try not to take the garbage of the day
any place but outside

Now me and Mr. Ace are gonna leave this place
and this fighting's gonna end
And if we're called back, I'm gonna knock you flat
and stack you end to end

Ah, I came, I saw, I declared martial law
I'm the marshall in the city
I came, I saw, I declared martial law
I'm the marshall in the city, ooohhh
I came, I saw, I declared martial law
I'm the marshall in the city
I came, I saw, I declared martial law
'cause I'm the marshall in the city

Rock,"Got a wife and kids in baltimore, jack
I went out for a ride and I never went back
Like a river that don't know where it's flowing
I took a wrong turn and I just kept going

Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart

I met her in a kingstown bar
We fell in love I knew it had to end
We took what we had and we ripped it apart
Now here I am down in kingstown again

Everybody's got a hungry

Everybody needs a place to rest
Everybody wants to have a home
Don't make no difference what nobody says
Ain't nobody like to be alone

Everybody's got a hungry heart"
Rock,"Over bridge of sighs
To rest my eyes in shades of green
Under dreamin' spires
To Itchycoo Park, that's where I've been

What did you do there?
I got high
What did you feel there?
Well I cried
But why the tears then?
I'll tell you why
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful

Feel inclined to blow my mind
Get hung up feeding ducks with a bun
They all come out to groove about
Be nicer than fun in the sun

Tell you what I'll do (what will you do?)
I'd like to go there now with you
You can miss out school (won't that be cool)
While I learn about the words of fools
What will we do there?
We'll get high
What will you touch there?
We'll Touch the sky
But why the tears then?
I'll tell you why

It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful

Pop,"BE AND BE NOT AFRAID

I believe in mistakes and accidents
That the nature of life is chaos and confusion
That man's rules of law and order
May not stand

And I should be and be not afraid
To reach for heaven

I may think that I know
The true heart's needs
But my pride may bring me low
Unable to see
I'm no closer than yesterday
But tomorrow I may stand

And be and be not afraid
To reach for heaven

I'll see the black car cavalcade
Lights on in the morn
I'll run fast and far away
I'll run without stopping
'Til hear and feet fail
Or until I can stand

And be and be not afraid
Be and be not afraid
Be and be not afraid
To reach for heaven

Pop,"Another hundred people just got off of the train and came up through the ground
While another hundred people just got off of the bus and are looking around
At another hundred people who got off of the plane and are looking at us
Who got off of the train and the plane and the bus, maybe yesterday

It's a city of strangers, some come to work, some to play
A city of strangers, some come to stare, some to stay
And every day, the ones who stay...

Can find each other in the crowded streets and the guarded parks
By the rusty fountains and the dusty trees and the battered barks
And they walk together past the postered walls with the crude remarks
And they meet at parties through the friends of friends who they'll never know

""Will you pick me up or do I meet you there or shall we let it go?""
""Did you get my message? 'Cause I looked in vain""
""Can we see each other Tuesday if it doesn't rain?""
""Look, I'll call you in the morning or my service will explain""

And another hundred people just got off of the train
It's a city of strangers, some come to work, some to play

By the rusty fountains and the dusty trees with the battered barks
And they walk together past upholstered walls with the crude remarks

Rock,"When I'm five
I will wash my face me hands all by myself
When I'm five
I will chew and spit tabacco like my grandfather Jones
'Cause I'm only four and five is far away

When I'm five
I will read the magazines in mummy's drawer
When I'm five
I will walk behind the soldiers in the May Day parade
'Cause I'm only four and grown-ups walk too fast

Yesterday was horrid day, 'cause Raymond kicked my shin
And mummy says if I am good, she'll let me go to school in August
Daddy shouted loud at mummy and I dropped my toast at breakfast
And I laughed when Bonzo licked my face, because it tickled
I wonder why my daddy cries and how I wish that I was nearly five

When I'm five
I will catch a butterfly and eat it and I won't be sick
When I'm five
I will jump in puddles, laugh in church and marry my mum
And I'll let my daddy do the washing-up

If I close one eye, the people on that side can't see me
I get headaches in the morning and I rode on Freddie's tricycle
And everywhere was funny, when I ran down to the sweetshop
Then I fell and bleeded-up my knee and everybody soppied me

I saw a photograph of Jesus and I asked him if he'd make me five
I saw a photograph of Jesus and I asked him if he'd make me five

Rock,"Wind is in the east
Stare at us eyes in wonder
Like beggars at a feast
We can't even, count the number
What you gonna do?
Send them table scraps we're leaving
One who care are few
Most spend there time, with useless meaning

Dear father,
Do you think that it will be alright?
Tell me mother,
Will we make it through?
We make it through the hungry night.

Somewhere in the west
Gold teeth, but sometime is gleaming
We know we are the best
Even know, the beasts lie screaming
We've got power to spare
A new clear day
Is dawning they say
But tell us, don't you dare
The piper has a price that we pay

Dear preacher,
Do you think that we'll see the light?
Tell me teacher,
Well we make it through?
We make it through the darkest night.

Two faces in the south
The first one has a look of
With fine words in his mouth
His heart is black,
As ghetto chimneys

What you gonna do?
To hide the shame,
Contain their anger.
What you gonna say?
You walk the line, of constant danger

Dear brother,
You think we'll have to stand and fight?
Tell me sister, Will we make it through?
We make it through the longest night.

Pop,"Darling please forgive me
I was sitting on the fence
I was slowly going out of my head
I did not hear a word that you said
I was enjoying myself sleeping in your flowerbed

If I could take your blows, If I could get pass go,
If I could find a way of fixing all the things that I broke
Then I would, if I could
And I might understand now I ended outta mind
And I might understand now I ended outta mind

But the truth is hard to find
When it’s playing tricks with your mind

Darling please forgive me
I was hanging with my friends
I was slowly getting outta my head
I did not hear a word that you said
I was enjoying myself sleeping in your flowerbed

And tell that you're eighty, but brother, you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's never there

Pop,"There would be psalms sung by a choir
I would have a white robe a halo newly acquired
I'd be at peace and I'd have no desire
If I'd lived right

There would be cherubs with tiny harps arrows and bows
I'd have a halo and a flowing white robe
I'd be enfolded by a celestial light
If I'd lived right

But I'm feeling hot and bothered under the collar
I feel the sweat breaking out on my brow
I feel the heat and I know it's the passion
The love I can't disavow

If this is a dream wake me up now
If this is a movie let's edit these scenes out
It would be a PG instead of an X-rated life
If I'd lived right

Some would call me a cheat call me a liar
Say that I've been defeated by the basest desires
Yes I have strayed and succumbed to my vices
But I tried to live right

But I have no regrets no guilts in my heart
I only feel sadness for any pain that I've caused
I guess I wouldn't bother to worry at all
If I'd lived right

Do you live by the book do you play by the rules?
Do you care what is thought by others about you?
If this day is all that is promised to you
Do you live for the future the present the past?

If there is one thing I know I know I will die
If anyone cares some stranger may critique my life
I may be revered or defamed and decried
But I tried to live right

There would be psalms sung by a choir
I would have a white robe a halo newly acquired
I'd be at peace and I'd have no desire
If I'd lived right"
Rock,"Johnny is a man
And he's bigger than you
But his overheads are high
And he looks straight through when you ask him how the kids are

He'll get home around seven
'Cause the chevy's real old
And he could have had a cadillac
If the school had taught him right
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk
blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse

And the food is on the table
But the food is cold
Don't hit her

""Can't you even cook?
What's the good of me working when you can't damn cook?""

Well Johnny is a man
And he's bigger than her
I guess the bruises won't show
If she wears long sleeves
But the space in her eyes shows through

And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
Shows through

Rock,"Where do you go when it's over
When the reverie goes up in flames
There's no such thing as tomorrow
When you love me then leave me this way

I know that it's over till you need me again
Your eyes avoid me, it's a game that I can't win
Wish I could be like you
And have a heart that can't be broken

You say you love me but you never say my name
There's someone else? Do you treat him just the same?
Are you hiding well, I wish I knew just what you're thinking

Wish you could see your face
You go some place no one can touch you

When you love me then leave me this way"
Rock,"Now her paints are dry...
and I looked outside...
at the corner boys

hey, oh, where'd you go?
I don't know?

I went to see your pictuers
i spread them across the floor
so this is where they are shown
now they're probablly saying to you...
""If you keep it up you;ll be born..""
but you will never listen
i'll bet

Burnt out grass
scorched by the sun
the buildings remain
we will beat them all to dust
I'll bet

Pulled from a headless shell
that blinked on and off hotel
now the nameless dwell
They hold your key and turn your knob
I'll bet

Would you say hello to my mom?
would you pay a visit to her?
she was an artist just like you were
would've introduced you to her
she would take me out on sundays
we go laughing through the garbage
she'd repaired legs like a docter
on the kitchen chairs we sat on
she was a unhappy just as you were
unhappy just as you were
unhappy just as you were
unhappy just as you were

I forgot to say I love you

You give me the strength I need to exist

On every corner of the street, sometimes it's all too insane
Baby you just got somethin', that's why I came home
It's somethin' I really need, an' now we can be alone

I just had to say I love you, and something else that I missed
To say how much I need you

I always know when fate gives a twist
You'll be there to soften the blow

You'll be there to soften the blow

In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This - Ooh, Ooh

Don't steal what I have got, baby,
'Cause it's hardly enough for myself.
Don't steal what I've got, baby,
'Cause the balance is thin like a shell.

I cherished the night of your marathon kiss,
Chemicals flying, oh I love this.
What's it all for if you can't feel the moment ?
What's it all for if you can't feel the moment,
The moment of kiss.

Fearless when I'm with you,
Fearless when I'm with you.
Fearless when I'm with you,
Fearless through and through.

What am I gonna wear ? I don't care.
Nobody sees the inside.
Oh, the radio's gonna take us out
Take us out on a ride.
I put on perfume and I walk in the room
The world stands still with you in the room.
I cross the floor and I'm high and I'm rich
When I'm under your lips and your fingertips.

I cherished the night of your marathon kiss,
Chemicals flying into the mist.
What's it all for if you can't feel the moment ?
What's it all for if you can't feel the power ?
What's it all for if you can't, can't live right here
In the hour, in the hour, in the hour ?

Cause I've been a dreamer too
You got that faraway look in your searching eyes
And a heart that's steady & true
I think I know what you're looking for
In the endless blue of the sky
You wait for the time when pigs fly

Get out here somebody tell you
That dreams are nothing but air
Did I hear somebody try to say
That imagination will take you nowhere
If anyone says it can't be done
As the time just simply reply
It's a beautiful thing when pigs fly

You never know and it will be
But they'll surely come around
Flashes of pink and flashes of gold
And a distant and joyful sound when pigs fly
Fly-yy

I know for a dreamer
Cause I've been a dreamer too
You got that faraway look in your searching eyes
And a heart that's steady & true
Are we suddenly seen a dozen remor?
Sailing in the clear blue sky
The time has come when pigs fly
Yeah, it's a beautiful thing when pigs fly"
Rock,"Well they built the Titanic to be one of a kind, but many ships have ruled the seas
They built the Eiffel Tower to stand alone, but they could build another if they please
Taj Mahal, the pyramids of Egypt, are unique I suppose
But when they built you, brother, they broke the mold

Now the world is filled with many wonders under the passing sun
And sometimes something comes along and you know it's for sure the only one
The Mona Lisa, the David, the Sistine Chapel, Jesus, Mary, and Joe
And when they built you, brother, they broke the mold

When they built you, brother, they turned dust into gold
When they built you, brother, they broke the mold

They say you can't take it with you, but I think that they're wrong
'Cause all I know is I woke up this morning, and something big was gone
Gone into that dark ether where you're still young and hard and cold
Just like when they built you, brother, they broke the mold

Now your death is upon us and we'll return your ashes to the earth
And I know you'll take comfort in knowing you've been roundly blessed and cursed
But love is a power greater than death, just like the songs and stories told
And when she built you, brother, she broke the mold

That attitude's a power stronger than death, alive and burning her stone cold
When they built you, brother"

When I was young

I met my first love at thirteen
She was brown and I was pretty green
And I learned quite a lot when I was young
When I was young

When I was young
Pain more painful
Laughter much louder
Yeah, when I was young
When I was young

My faith was so much stronger then
I believed in fellow man
And I was so much older then
When I was young
When I was young
When I was young"
Rock,"You can kick and you can scream
Wake me up from this bad dream
You can run and you can hide
But here I come, baby, step aside

Don't say no, don't say maybe
Be my lover, be my baby
You can't justify the politician's crime
You can't nullify the terror in his mind

Angry young man
He's an angry young man
Angry young man
Can you feel his rage
Angry young man

He's up against the wall
How can you live
When everyone is scared to death
You gave all you can give

Mad at your own history
The future's even worse
Where did they go wrong
Who gave him this curse

Angry young man
Angry young man
Angry young man
Can you feel his rage

Angry young man
He's screaming in his cage

He's an angry young man

All the time you've had and never used

And no one to find a song to play

And there's nothing that you can say
You can make it most any day

Rock,"Travelling in a fried-out Kombi
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
She took me in and gave me breakfast
And she said,

""Do you come from a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder?
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You'd better run, you'd better take cover.""

Buying bread from a man in Brussels
He was six foot four and full of muscle
I said, ""Do you speak-a my language?""
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich
And he said,

""I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You'd better run, you'd better take cover.""

Lying in a den in Bombay
With a slack jaw, and not much to say
I said to the man, ""Are you trying to tempt me
Because I come from the land of plenty?""
And he said,

""Oh! Do you come from a land down under (oh yeah yeah)
Where women glow and men plunder?
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You'd better run, you'd better take cover."""

All cameras focused on me
Helicopters up above
Oh, what a travesty

There's a crazy world at war
Right outside of my front door
They're wasting time on me
I'm just a jailhouse baby

Oh, I'm singing so sleepy
Jailhouse baby
No window to the world
I'm a little, I'm a little jailbird

Oh, I'm singing so sleepy
Jailhouse baby
No window to the world
(I'm a little, I'm a little jailbird)

Cool nights and freezing water,
Fluorescents always on
Stuck here behind this glass
My parents see their daughter

Judge, you're no celebrity
You're a desperate wannabe
Sourpuss, you'd rather leave
Real criminals on the streets

Oh, I'm singing so sleepy
Jailhouse baby
No window to the world
I'm a little, I'm a little jailbird

Oh, I'm singing so sleepy
Jailhouse baby
No window to the world
(I'm a little, I'm a little jailbird)

Handcuffs and cold concrete
Notes slipped right under my door
Look at me, caught in this cage
Just like an enemy

Like a public enemy
Make a martyr out of me
How dangerous can I be?
I'm just a jailhouse baby

Oh, I'm singing so sleepy
Jailhouse baby
No window to the world
I'm a little, I'm a little jailbird

Oh, I'm singing so sleepy
Jailhouse baby
No window too the world
(I'm a little, I'm a little jailbird)

All those lonely nights of terror
I thank you for your letters
Words from around the world
For the lonely, little jailbird

Still haunted by my errors
Why's the system so unfair?
But I'm stronger than before
No, I'm no longer scared.

Oh, I'm singing so sleepy
Jailhouse baby
No window to the world
I'm a little, I'm a little jailbird

Oh, I'm singing so sleepy
Jailhouse baby
No window to the world

Rock,"Walkin' in the park just the other day, baby,
What do you, what do you think I saw?
Crowds of people sittin' on the grass with flowers in their hair said,
""Hey, Boy, do you wanna score?""
And you know how it is.
I really don't know what time it was, woh, oh,oh
so I asked them if I could stay awhile.

I didn't notice but it had got very dark and I was really
Really out of my mind.
Just then a policeman stepped up to me and asked us, said, ""Please,hey,
would we care to all get in line, Get in line.""
Well, you know, they asked us to stay for tea and have some fun; Oh, oh,oh.
he said that his friends would all drop by, ooh.

Why don't you take a good look at yourself and describe what you see,
and baby, baby, baby, do you like it?
There you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rustin',
ah, not trying to fight it.
You really don't care if they're comin'; oh, oh,
I know that it's all a state of mind.

If you go down in the streets today, baby, you better,
you better open your eyes. WOAH WOAH YEAH
Folk down there really don't care, really don't care, don't care , really don't , which, which way the pressure lies,
so I've decided what I'm gonna do now.
So I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains
where the spirits go now,
over the hills where the spirits fly.
I really don't know."

Rock,"Lord, I miss that girl
On the day we met the sun was shining down
Down on the valley
Riddled with horses running
Crushing them with flowers
I would have picked for her
On the day she was born
She runs through my veins like a long black river
And rattles my cage like a thunderstorm
Oh my soul

What does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean to be so sad?
When someone you love
Someone you love is supposed to make you happy
What do you do
How do you keep love alive?
When it won't
What, what are the words
They use when they know it's over
""We need to talk,"" or
""I'm confused, maybe later you can come over""
I would've held your mother's hand
On the day you was born
She runs through my veins
Like a long black river and rattles my cage
Like a thunderstorm
Oh, my soul
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean to be so sad?
When someone you love
Someone you love is supposed to make you happy
What do you do
How do you keep love alive?
When it won't
How do you keep love alive?"

When you're heart aches (on Diamond Road)

Every road has led us here today
Little bird, what's troubling you
You know what you have to do
What is yours you'll never lose
And what's ahead may shine
Beneath the promise of blue skies
With broken wings we'll learn to fly
Pull yourself out of the tide
And begin the dream again

So don't miss the diamonds along the way
Every road has led us here today
Won't you shine on
Morning light
Burn the darkness away
Walk with me the Diamond Road
Tell me everything is gold
Give me something of your soul
So you don't fade away

Don't miss the diamonds along the way
Every road has led us here today
Life is what happens while you're making plans
All that you need is right here in your hands.

And the way I know just what you mean

It's a funny feeling deep inside
So many different sides
But still so easy to define

Cause you'll know it every time
And its not just in your mind
You can feel the butterflies
Sending chills down your spine

What is love
But a kiss on a rainy day
A smile that won't go away
A safe place to run

What is love
But a complicated simple truth
A bond between me and you
The number one
Oh that's love

And the things that never cross your mind
Now you're doing all of the time
Cause with someone special it's so right

It's like dancing when you walk
And singing when you talk
And you're happy just to be alive

Live in the moment don't pretend
Let it go or take it in
You don't have to understand
The how why and whens

So take off your hat and stay for a minute
Love is a precious thing
If you let it in
You'll never know what you'll find till you give it some time
Some time

Has touched your face.

Her smile told of no night.
Your love for her grew
With each rising sun.

And then one winter day
His hand laid her away,
She left you here
Drowning in your tears,
Here, where you've stayed for years,
Crying,""Lisa, Lisa.""

Pop,"I close my eyes, still I can see you clearly
And it burst me up inside, yeah...
Another night I miss you here beside me
Try to figure out my life

Oh, I made the way too long
And now she's moving on alone
She said she was headed

Back to her future, throwing the heads up
We were going nowhere
She said she would have left sooner
I thought I would chase her, she don't feel the same
And if I don't make a move
I'm sure gonna loose the biggest part of me
So whatever it takes I'm gonna find a way
To get back in her future

Deep inside I try to find the reason why
I couldn't give the strength you needed
Reaching out, where are the pieces missing?
How could I let it slip away?

Oh, I made the way too long
And now she's moving on alone
She said she was headed

Back to her future, throwing the heads up
We were going nowhere
She said she would have left sooner
I thought I would chase her, she don't feel the same
And if I don't make a move
I'm sure gonna loose the biggest part of me
So whatever it takes I'm gonna find a way
To get back in her future

All in all I can't blame her
For calling it quits
Should have been more attentive
To her every needs

She said she was headed

Back to her future, throwing the heads up
We were going nowhere
She said she would have left sooner
I thought I would chase her, she don't feel the same
And if I don't make a move
I'm sure gonna loose the biggest part of me
So whatever it takes I'm gonna find a way
To get back in her future"
Rock,"jodie wears a hat although it hasn't rained for six days
she says a girl needs a gun these days
hey, on account of those rattlesnakes
on account of those rattlesnakes

she looks like eva marie saint
in on the waterfront
she reads simone de beauvoir
in her american circumstance
hey..

she's less than sure if her heart has come to stay in san jose
and her neverborn child haunts her now
as she speeds down the freeway
as she tries her luck with the traffic police
out of boredom more than spite
she never finds no trouble, she tries too hard
she's oblivious despite herself
hey..

she looks like eva marie saint
in on the waterfront, she says
all she needs is therapy
all you need is love is all you need

jodie never sleeps 'cause there are always needles in the hay, hey
she says a girl needs a gun these days
hey, on account of the rattlesnakes
hey, on account of the rattlesnakes

she looks like eva marie saint
in on the waterfront
she reads simone de beauvoir
in her american circumstance
her heart's like crazy paving
upside down and back to front, she says
ooh, it's so hard to love when
love was your great disappointment

on account of those rattlesnakes
she says a girl needs a gun these days, hey
she says a girl needs a gun these days
hey, on account of the rattlesnakes
hey, on account of those rattlesnakes"
Pop,"Oh, please
Don't, don't lead me on
Don't love me tonight if tomorrow you'll be gone
If you don't mean the things that you say
You only have to tell me
And I'll be on my way

Oh, don't
Don't make me cry
Don't say that you care if your love is just a lie
Don't build my hopes up to the sky
Please don't dont lead me on

If
If you're gonna hurt me
Then please, please don't make me wait
Should we part I'll get along somehow
So if you're gonna break my then come on break it now

Oh, don't
Don't make me cry
Don't say that you care if your love is just a lie
Don't build my hopes up to the sky
Please don't dont lead me on
"
Rock,"When I believed in nothing I called her name
Trapped in a high-dollar joint in some place I called her name
And though my days are slipping by
And nights so cruel I thought I'd die
She danced her little dance 'till it made me cry
She was shakin' like this honey doing that

When I needed soul revival I called your name
When I was falling to pieces I screamed in pain

Your soothing hand that turned me round
A love so real swept over me
You danced your little dance 'till it made me cry
You were shakin' like this honey doing that

Never let me down She never let me down
Never let me down She never let me down

When all your faith is failing Call my name
When you've nothing coming Call my name

I'll be strong for all it takes
I'll cover your head till the bad stuff breaks
I'll dance my little dance till it makes you smile
Shaking like this honey doing that

Never let you down I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down I'll never let you down"
Rock,"Chorus
I'm all mixed up, I'm all mixed up about,
All mixed up about you

And no I can't find no reason
To explain the way that I feel
I remember things being clearer
At one time things were more real

(Repeat Chorus)

I'm not lookin' for sympathy
I'm just frightened by this apathy
Like footsteps way in the back of me
On a narrow street of stone

And if time will answer all questions
Then perhaps a film will be shown
Everyone could mail-order tickets
Yeah, you could sell a lot of shirts
For the last picture show"
Rock,"Well, I've been thinking a lot
'Bout the life that I got
And I'm grateful
And I am trying as hard
As I can to bring my best
To the table
And I don't want no regrets
I'll be counting my debts
When I'm done
And I'll be living my life
On the edge of a knife
In the sun

It's like I'm in a dream
Burning oil and gasoline
Nobody gonna mess with me

You know you're playing
With solar fire
When your star
Begins to shine
You know you're playing
With solar fire
Light up the night
With solar fire

Well, they told me in school
Not to mess with the rules
And be careful
Yea, but you can't make advance
Without taking a chance
So here I did

Nobody stand in my way
I'm ready to play
My crew is pouring the gasoline
Yea

You know you're playing
With solar fire
When your star
Begins to shine
You know you're playing
With solar fire
Light up tonight

You know you're playing
With solar fire
When your star
Begins to shine
You know you're playing
With solar fire
Light up tonight"
Rock,"Headin' in or headin' out
Standing on the shore
Pause a moment to reflect
Which trip costs you more
Between the ever restless crowds

And the silence of your room
Spend an hour in no man's land
You'll be leaving soon

Victims come and victims go
There's always lots to spare
One victim lives the tragedy
One victim stops to stare

And still another walks on by
Pretending not to see
They're all out there in no man's land
'Cause it's the safest place to be

But sanctuary never comes
Without some kind of risk
Illusions without freedom

Never quite add up to bliss
The haunting and the haunted
Play a game no one can win
The spirits come at midnight

And by dawn they're gone again
And so it seems our destiny
To search and never rest
To ride that ever changing wave
That never seems to crest

To shiver in the darkest night
Afraid to make a stand
And then go back and do our time
Out there in no man's land"
Rock,"[verse 1]
Hands will take their place
Far from intentions made
Disguised as patience, time gets wasted
Now is for the now, so get loud

[chorus]
I'm, I'm destination addicted
I just gotta be some place else
Never good time
Never feel the space to get it right
Get right
[verse 2]
Hands will find their way
To eyes inches from my face
My heart gets beating, I drink freely
How to hold it down, hold it down?

[chorus]
I'm, I'm destination addicted
I just gotta be some place else
Never good time
Never feel the space to get it right
Get right

[bridge]
Okay, okay, enough
Let me explain
Okay, okay, enough
Get on with it
Maybe if I stand up straight
One small thing I can change
Maybe if I, maybe if I

[chorus]
I'm, I'm destination addicted
I just gotta be some place else
Never good time
Never feel the space to get it right
Get right"
Rock,"The young ones,
Darling we're the young ones,
And young ones shouldn't be afraid.

To live, love
While the flame is strong,
for we won't be the young ones very long.

Tomorrow,
why wait till tomorrow,
Tomorrow sometimes never comes.
Love, me,
there's a song to be sung
And the best time is to sing while we're young.

Once in every lifetime
comes a love like this.
I need you and you need me.
Oh my darling can't you see.
Young dreams
Should be dreamed together,
Young hearts shouldn't be afraid.
And some day when the years have flown
Darling, this will teach the young ones of our own.
The young ones
Darling, we're the young ones
The young ones
Darling, we're the young ones."

Independence Day

I know I make mistakes
I will have to live and learn
Sometimes you play with fire
And sometimes you get burned
I have my dream to live
Following that star
It doesn't matter how long it takes
It doesn't matter how far
No time for make believing
And it's too late to turn back now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I've been dreaming about it
I can't live without it
I've got to find my own way
I'm not changing my mind now
Or looking behind now
This is my independence day
My independence day
I know it will take some time
But I won't give up the fight
Cause sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
But that's all right
Oh yeah
I've got to spread my wings
And learn how to fly
Cause this feeling drives me on
It's something I cannot deny
No time to make excuses
Cause it's too late to turn back now
Yeah, yeah yeah
I've been dreaming about it
I can't live without it
I've got to find my own way
I'm not changing my mind now
Or looking behind now
This is my independence day

Rock,"Now there's a dance I can see that the kids all do
It's called ""the Mess Around"", you can mess around too
Come on mess around, yeah it's Mess Around

Rock,"Frustration
In my lexicon of hate
I see you with your portraiture
Does he love you?
Does he love you too?

The brush strokes
Kiss your breasts and toes
I cry icicles in my stein
The heartbeats flutter
With an abnormal rhythm

The pain shoots through my body
A sword between my thighs
I wish that I could kill you
But I too love your eyes

You’re feeling less whore but you stimulate
The hatred smolders in your eyes
I’d drop to my knees in a second
To salivate in your thighs

But all I do is fall over
I don’t have the strength I once had
In you and your prickless lover
And his easel in his eyes

I feel the pain creep up my leg
Blood runs from my nose
I puke my guts out at your feet
You’re more man than I
To be dead to have no feeling
To be dry and spermless like a girl

I want so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
Marry me
I want you as my wife

Spermless like a girl
More man than I
More man than I

Frustration
In my lexicon of hate
You’re feeling less like a whore but you
Stimulate

All I do is fall over
I don’t have the strength I once had
All I do is fall over
I don’t have the strength I once had

I want you so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
I want you as a wife

Frustration is my lexicon of hate
Frustration is my lexicon of hate
Fru… fru… frustration, my lexicon of hate

I cry icicles
Heartbeats flutter
Abnormal rhythm

I wish that I could kill you
But I too love your eyes
I want you as my wife
I want you as my wife
Spermless like a girl

Lucky in feeling
More man than I
Marry me, marry me, marry me
I want you as a wife
Spermless like a girl
Puking my guts at your feet
More man than I
Fru… fru… fru… frustration
Frustration"
Rock,"When you’re slipping into sleep, that’s the time to unwind
Sinking down into the deep, that’s the time of no time
When you’re slipping into sleep
All the sounds around you seem to have a new meaning
Leave your body behind you with a different feeling
When you’re slipping into sleep

The day is night, the night is day
So please out the light as I slip away
Up the wooden hills to Bedfordshire
Up the wooden hills to Bedfordshire

When you’re slipping into sleep, there’s a world you will find
That’s all yours and you can keep, that’s the only thing to keep
When you’re slipping into sleep
All the sounds around you seem to have a new meaning
Leave your body behind you with a different feeling
When you’re slipping into sleep"
Rock,"Well, she comes to me like a childhood soul

Or an old time friend I ain't seen so long
When she sings to me, it's like a loving song
She can be so sweet, she don't do me no wrong

You mean so much to me, baby
You know you drive me crazy
You mean so much to me, baby
I want you for my girl

Well, sometimes she's like a baby playing with a toy,
Then she's so much woman she makes me feel like a little boy
And when she comes to me, and she's all alone,
And she cries: """"Oh daddy, oh Daddy make me strong!""""

That's when she means so much to me baby,
You know you drive me crazy
You mean so much to me, baby
I want you for my girl"
Pop,"Hey! little mama,

Wreaking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?

This is my fight song, take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now ill be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worryed about me
I'm in too deep, you say I'm in too deep
It's been two years, I miss my home
But there's a fire burning in my bones
Still believe, yeah, I still believe

And you like to play slow
And leave me wanting more

Cause I can't get enough of your love
No, I can't get enough of your love

So precious it should never end

Stand up, say it loud
What we need is a lot more love
Stand up, say it loud
What we need is a lotta good good love


Tonight is our turn
We have the opportunity
Donâ€™t be afraid
Want to make you happy
Satisfy the dreams inside our heads


Ooh daylight comes around so fast
I wanna make this evening last
Ooh baby, Iâ€™ve given my best


Stand up, say it loud
What we need is a lotta love
Stand up, shout it out
What we need is a lot more love


Ooh baby, new dreams to share
And someone that will truly care
If youâ€™re lonely
I will always be there


Stand up, say it loud
What we need is a lot more love
Stand up, shout it out"
Rock,"A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes right
Poor little Greenie

CHORUS
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
Jean Genie let yourself go!

Sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie

He's so simple minded he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved, loves to be loved

There's such a distance between you and your family.
Just can't see things from the same point of view.

Papa wants a lawyer and mama she wants an author,
And all you want is for them to want you.

Well, i saw lot of bad signs and we had some real bad timesback on the east coast.
And i guess you could say it took california to bring us close.
There was a lot of hard livin' and some stone cold women on the east coast.
And i saw my papa turn away when i need him the most.
And california, she's an angel.
Lo, so heavenly dressed
And the pacific she's a woman
The lord must have loved her best.
I got a california rainbow to come give them thunder clouds a rest
And the mountain is my friend now, she put me to her test
Well you know every father has dreams and schemes fo his own kid.
And dreaming it ain't been declaired no capital crime
But i just hope when i grow up to have my own kids
I'll love them all i can and let 'em make their own minds
Now you know how a mother can hold the son through understanding.
And my father he once held me close by crying.
Whoa, and my mama's love it don't ever leave me standing.
And papa's love it just leaves me smiling.
Whoa, and my mama she's a rainbow,
Gotta see hen on sunday when she's dressed
Whoa, and my papa he's a good man, he gives me and mama his best.
Whoa, my mama she's a rainbow, come to give them thunder clouds a rest.
And my family is my friend now california put us through her test"
Rock,"You noticed that I closed my eyes again
And smiled in all the silence
I have grown in me for you.
But then, what accident of stars
Brought you so late into my arms
Where even now another sleeps ?
Here in my heart I know that you and I are one.
I wonder if some joker laughs as he looks on
I wonder if some joker laughs as he looks on
I wonder if some joker laughs as he looks on
At all our misplaced love, all our misplaced love.

You noticed that I turned my head away
And cried for all the goodness
I have found deceiving you.
Ah well, how could we know the hand
Fate chose to be our guide was tired
Of lover's bliss and holding hands
And deep in my heart I know that you and I are one.
I wonder if some joker sighs for what we've done
I wonder if some joker sighs for what we've done
I wonder if some joker sighs for what we've done
With all our misplaced, all our misplaced love.

I noticed that you touched my soul in time
And lied to stop my leaving
For a place where no one hears.
But then what randomness and chance
Could move the mountain from our dreams,
Or break the spell upon us now ?
And though deep in my heart I know you and I are one
I wonder if the joker dies what will become
I wonder if the joker dies what will become
I wonder if the joker dies what will become
Of all our misplaced love.

All our misplaced love.
"
Rock,"Then he said, “Mom I want to forna…
I mean formulate and discover the realms of the unknown
with Mary Jane
After all you’ll be away for the weekend
Just please consent
I need a friend”

I admit your puberty was somewhat strange
Could this be fixed with Mary Jane?
Mary Jane Mary Jane Mary Jane Who?

So I said, Son you want to permeate
And discover the realms of the unknown
With Mary Jane
After all the other boys that are your age
They only wake to medicate

Do I know her family?
Is she even mannerly when she’s out in society?
“She even bakes”
She even bakes?
“These odd brownies”
Mary Jane Mary Jane Mary Jane Who?

Then he said, “I believe in her family,
On her maternal side there was a
Dr. Tetrahydrocannabinol Pure Isomer Dronabinol
Mary Jane Who.

Pop,"(Dream, dream, dream, dream)

Hello, hello, hello, can I hear an echo?
Purple, red, and yellow
I can't wait to get home
Head down on the pillow
Holding you is all I think about
You're asleep in London, I wish you were coming
Back home to me, darling, you're too far away
Count back from one hundred
Holding you is all I think about

Oh, baby, when I'm apart from you
I just shut my eyes, all I have to do

Is dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
(About you, about you, about you, about you)
(About you, about you, about you, about you)

Hello, hello, hello, walking through a meadow
Full of sunflowers, picking off the petals
I don't wanna wake up without you laying next to me, yeah
I'm no good at waiting, all the separation
Feeling suffocated, I just need to breathe
And I'm starting to hate it
I can't wait to fall asleep

Oh, baby, when I'm apart from you
I just close my eyes
And all I have to do

Is dream, dream, dream, dream

Rock,"Yesterdays, yesterdays,
Days I knew as happy sweet sequestered days.
Olden days, golden days,

Joyous free and flaming life

Sad am I, glad am I,
For today I'm dreaming of
Yesterdays.

Rock,"I know
you know every desperado
and sharp shooter in the west
you say that i can't see behind the mask
of those who call themselves the good guys
in this who take and take
""so are you with me or not
you say this time decide""

balmy days sweet sangria
she's been gone
have you seen her
señorita shyly turning away
leaving me our fading flame
yeah you think you that
what you believe in
it matters now to you and me

what you believe in i'm takin' in
i said i'm takin' in
what you believe in
it matters now to you and me

before sundown the mexicans leave san antone
the car will then drop him at the border
the breaking point
i know your people have suffered
time and time again
but what about i ask you now
the innocents on both sides

balmy days so you give me
a no window i ask you,
give me a bloodless road
tell me why does someone have to lose?"
Rock,"I never knew her name
I only knew her fame
She lived near my town
Another goldfish to drown
Well I just past the bridge
That parts us from them
The bridge that she used
Again and again
Again

I remember when they found her
Billy Davey's daughter
The word gets around

Billy Davey's second daughter
Threw herself to dirty water
Billy's left with nothing but a dream

He dreams ...
"
Rock,"She took a rolled-up twenty
Out of her pocket
And paid for my cigarettes
We were friends at first sight
In the 7-Eleven light
She said here let me cover it
And I rode shotgun all that night
She drove and never made a sound
When I asked if there was
Anything wrong
She said nothin' worth talking about
It's a blue sunday
Down the interstate
It's a blue sunday
Blue with shades of gray

Her back seat could have been a hotel
I slept for a thousand years
Every now and then she'd
Laugh out loud for no reason
I pretended not to hear
And rolled my jacket up under my head
And stretched my body out
Couldn't be too far in front
Of her daddy's bloodhounds
But I ain't gonna worry now

It's a blue sunday
Down the interstate
It's a blue sunday
Blue with shades of gray
Yeah you know me
We've never met before
It's a blue sunday"
Pop,"BEAUTIFUL INTENTIONS

I couldn't help but open my big mouth
As I stumbled into you the words fell out
Well you asked me the question and I just couldn't lie
But why did you bother when you knew what you'd find
No no no
I didn't mean to leave you standing in the dark

So blind that I can't decide if you knew that I harboured
Beautiful intentions for you
So cruel that I never knew truly
If you harboured beautiful intentions for me

When they give you your identity
Tell me will you recognise yourself?
You're so influenced by the things that you hear
Down with the smoke screen to make everything clear
Oh oh oh
You gotta learn to live and take it in your stride


So blind that I can't decide if you knew that I harboured
Beautiful intentions for you
So cruel that I never knew truly
If you harboured beautiful intentions for me
So blind
So blind
So blind
So blind

Jaded with exhausting pressure
Will I feel like this forever?
Faded inconsistent pleasure
Wear me down wear me out
Jaded with exhausting pressure
Will I feel like this forever?
Faded inconsistent pleasure
Wear me down wear me out

So blind that I can't decide if you knew that I harboured
Beautiful intentions for you
So cruel that I never knew truly
If you harboured beautiful intentions for me


I wanna know did I disappoint you?
It still hurts to mention the words that were spoken now
I wanna know, are you contemplating?
The beautifully intended yet tainted impression of me

So blind that I can't decide if you knew I had
Beautiful intentions for you
And so cruel that I never knew
If you had beautiful intentions for me

Rock,"Right now, nothing else matters
You and me and the Georgia night
Look around cause it don't get any better
Have you ever felt so alright?

Let's dance, take it slow
Tom Petty on the radio
And we're singing 'bout American girls like you
When I look in your eyes, all I want to do is

Bang bang, baby, like the 4th of July
A lightning strike in the midnight sky
Don't give a damn about the summertime blues
All I need is red, white and you
Can't let those colors fade
Tell me you're gonna stay
American girls making dreams come true
All I need is red, white and

You pulling me a little bit closer
Heart beating like a big bass drum
We spinning on a roller coaster
Free falling into your young mode

All the bad girls rocking in cut-off jeans
And good ol' boys driving big machines
And you can kiss my ass, can't help but say
It's good to be born in the USA

Bang bang, baby, like the 4th of July
A lightning strike in the midnight sky
Don't give a damn about the summertime blues
All I need is red, white and you
Can't let those colors fade
Tell me you're gonna stay
American girls making dreams come true
All I need is red, white and you

Baby, sweet potato pie
All I need is red, white and
Baby, what we gonna do
And honey, don't give a damn about the summertime blues
All I need is

Bang bang, baby, like the 4th of July
A lightning strike in the midnight sky
Don't give a damn about the summertime blues
All I need is red, white and you
Can't let those colors fade
Tell me you're gonna stay
American girls making dreams come true
All I need is red, white and you
Baby, baby, all I need is red, white and you
Don't give a damn about the summertime blues
All I need is red, white and you"
Rock,"Oh give me a home where the buffalo roam,
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

Well jackson made deals, a thief down to his heels,
Had a long trail of tears
The smokies could hide cherokee bride,
Her brave was shot yesterday

Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

Mmm, we know it's not caroline
Your home is your home the range
May be fine for some but not in my eyes.
Home, home on the range
The smokies always hide
Cherokee bride but in her eyes
We know it's not caroline.

Yes, yes america
Hey, ah, america
Oh, who discovered your ass?
The white man came, this land is my land,
This is your land they sang.

Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day,
And the skies are not cloudy all day,
And the skies are not cloudy all day."
Rock,"no one's picking up the phone
guess it's me and me
and this little masochist
she's ready to confess
all the things that I never thought
that she could feel and

hey Jupiter
nothing's been the same
so are you gay
are you blue
thought we both could use a friend to run to
and I thought I wouldn't have to be
with you something new

sometimes I breathe you in
and I know you know
and sometimes you take a swim
found your writing on my wall
if my heart's soaking wet
boy your boots can leave a mess

hey Jupiter
nothing's been the same so are you gay
are you blue
thought we both could use a friend to run to
and I thought you wouldn't have to keep
with me hiding

thought I knew myself so well
all the dolls I had
took my leather off the shelf
your apocalypse was fab
for a girl who couldn't choose between
the shower or the bath

and I thought I wouldn't have to be
with you
a magazine

no one's picking up the phone
guess it's clear he's gone
and this little masochist
is lifting up her dress
guess I thought I could never feel the things I feel
hey Jupiter

Pop,"I sit and wait
Does an angel contemplate my fate
And do they know
The places where we go
When we're grey and old
'cause I've been told
That salvation lets their wings unfold
So when I'm lying in my bed
Thoughts running through my head
And I feel that love is dead
I'm loving angels instead

Chorus:
And through it all he offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call he won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead

When I'm feeling weak
And my pain walks down a one way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love
And as the feeling grows
He breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead
I'm loving angels instead

Chorus:
And through it all he offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call he won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead

Chorus:
And through it all he offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call he won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead"
Rock,"All my love came to nothing at all my love
When I woke up to find
You were no longer mine

All my love thrown away after all the time
Now there's no place for me in the future
you see

I don't understand you
I've done all I can do
Tell me how could I give you more
more than all my love"
Rock,"Well then
I guess that's it then
As you trip on my rug on your way out the door
To your new found freedom
You always get your way

Happy
We can't be happy
For I've learned
That reality is only opinion
We disagreed, dear
Some opinions can't persuade

Crazy
My thinkin' was hazy
Placin' you
In the kitchen with apron and skillet preparing me dinner
But to serve's not your fortay

Lonely
I bet I was only
Lookin' in your direction for some small affection
But you made me love you
Cuz you always get your way

Always always
Isn't it boring?
Day after day
After day
After day
After day

Your suspicion
And all my ambition
Creates nothing less than an incredible mess
So I guess good luck darlin'
Is all I have to say

Kill me
You said you'd kill me
Baby those are just words
That in anger
You say but I surely would hate it
If you ever got your way
And you always get your way
You always get your way

"
Rock,"Over where the rainbow meets the darkened sky.
I pretended there was hope for you and I.
Now to late I guess the real world I find.
You changed your mind, you changed your mind.

Over where tomorrow chases clouds away.
I pretended that somehow you'd really stay.
Now I'm left here with those dreams you tossed away.
You changed your mind, you changed your mind.

( Guitar Solo )

Over where the rainbow meets the darkened sky.
I believed that we would never say goodbye.
Now I'm standing here alone to late to cry.
You changed your mind, you changed your mind.
You changed your mind, you changed your mind.

I want your love, I need you love.
To late you changed your mind.
I want your love, I still need your love.
To late you changed your mind.
Oh, you changed you mind,
oh, you changed your mind,
you changed your mind.
Oh, you changed your mind.

Rock,"Don't keep me hangin' on a string
Tell me what I feel is no big thing
Don't Turn away I'm Listening
Over and over again

Don't give me visions to explain
There are no doubts I feel the strain
Of all my senses yearning
Over and over again

Every day I see you
Every day I need you
Every way I breath you
On and on and on and on again

its not important to wonder why
What is just is no more imply
This simple thought repeating
Over and over again

Every day I see you
Every day I need you
Every way I breath you
On and on and on and on again

Imaging all the ways to cope
I close my eyes, that gives my hope
It cures the silence

Every day I see you
Every day I need you
Every way I breath you
On and on and on and on again
"
Rock,"You plant a rose
And if the rose comes up
You're thankful to God
And when it doesn't you cuss him
You raise a child
And when the child grows up
You got to learn to let go
If you can't learn to love him
But, oh, what a beautiful thing when you sing
Hear all them bells ringing out in the street
Hammer strikes the metal and it makes me believe
'Cause if I don't believe in love
Then I don't believe in you
And I do

Now I'm not saying only bad news comes
For the people who want it
But you gotta play that music for who's listening
You got to have someone you wanna sing it to
Oh, what a beautiful thing when you sing
Hear all them bells ringing out in the street
Blue sky cracking and it makes me believe
Oh, hear all them bells ringing out in the street
Hammer strikes the metal and it makes me believe
'Cause if I don't believe in love
Then I don't believe in you
And I do

Close my eyes, see the glorious sunset
Through the windows of a store and I want it
Anyway, if I ever felt haunted
You were there for me
These angry people who are waiting to judge you
Have their own judgment that they'll have live up to
Open your mouth
And if nothing come through
Remember
You're the one that sings
And it's a gift
And life's a beautiful thing
Oh, don't waste it doll
You build a house and if the house comes up
You gotta work on that house
If you want to make it your home
'Cause everything inside that's not something you own
Is what you're taking with you
On the day that you go
And oh, what a beautiful world when we sing
Hear all them bells ringing out in the street
Hammer strikes the metal and it makes me believe
Hear all them bells ringing out in the street
Oh, hammer strikes the metal and it makes me believe
'Cause if I don't believe in love
Then I don't believe in you
And I do"
Rock,"Every night I dream you're next to me
Tenderly
You say my name
You stay close enough to keep me here
Then disappear
When we're face to face

And if you carry me tonight
I would be strong enough to fight
And when you're weak and can't go on
I'd be the bed you lay upon
And blue is blue
And so am I
'Cause I want to be with you tonight
And you're not the only one in need

You know everybody's watching me
And what they see
Is me watching you
In the middle, time is creeping by
And I wonder why
You're so removed

And if you carry me tonight
I would be strong enough to fight
And when you're weak and can't go on
I'd be the bed you lay upon
And blue is blue
And so am I
'Cause I want to be with you tonight
And you're not the only one in need

Come on baby
Life is just a net into which you dive
And I'm getting
Closer to you now

If I love you
Will you run away
And if I stay
Will I disappear

And if you carry me tonight
I would be strong enough to fight
And when you're weak and can't go on
I'd be the bed you lay upon
And blue is blue
And so am I
'Cause I want to be with you tonight
And you're not the only one in need

Rock,"You look so sad - like you lost your only friend
Don't feel so bad - you can always try again
So don't hide, go seek, don't let the grass grow
Under your feet
Get out, get up, get on, get moving out
Don't surrender - don't give up the fight

You give a little bit more
If you want her back - it's a full attack
You give a little bit more
And if you wanna win you don't give in you
Give a little bit more
When you think you're through what you gotta do is
Give a little bit more

She said goodbye
So tell yourself that's all
(That's all, she's gone)
But your hands ain't tied
Why you make yourself so small (don't think so small)
So don't hide - go seek - don't let the grass grow
Under your feet
Get out - get up - get on - get moving out
Don't surrender - don't give up the fight

You give a little bit more
If you want her back - it's a full attack
You give a little bit more
And if you wanna win you don't give in
Give a little bit more
When you think you're through what you gotta do you
Give a little bit more

Don't give up the fight - you gotta keep on
Going with all you might
Try hard don't stop - gotta keep on giving it
All you got
Never give up - never give up - never say die
Believe in, can reach the top
Gotta give it a shot don't say no gotta
Get in the flow

So don't hide go seek
Don't runaway - get back on your feet
Get out - get up - get on - get moving out
Don't surrender - don't give up the fight

You give a little bit more
If you want her back - it's a full attack
You give a little bit more
And if you wanna win you don't give in
Give a little bit more
When you think you're through what you gotta do
Give a little bit more"
Rock,"Wake up you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
Look out my window and what do I see
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

What are we coming to
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden Ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned
What we were here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Oh you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior

Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself they belong to you
They're the start of the coming race
The earth is a bitch
We've finished our news
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Oh you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior"
Rock,"With a strut into the room
With his hat cocked sure defiantly
He said ""I, I have heard
That you can play the way I like it to be played.""
I said, ""I can play, anyway that you want.
But first I want, I want to know

Baby is it sweet sweet
Sweet the sting
Is it real this infusion
Can it heal where others before have failed?
If so then somebody
Shake shake shake me sane
'cause I am inching ever closer to the tip of this scorpion's tail""

He said ""I laid my weapons
down with my pistol
Fully loaded, a hunted man
To my root, will it end
Or begin in your cinnabar juice?""

Is it sweet sweet
Sweet the sting
Is it real this infusion
Can it heal where others before have failed?
If so then somebody
Shake shake shake me sane
'cause I am inching ever closer to the tip of this scorpion's tail""

Love let me breathe
Breathe you in
Melt the confusion
Until there is
There is your - union"

I want you close, I want you closer

It's hard to tell just what you're after

You say, you want all of me today
But tomorrow's not the same
My feelings never change
What do you want from me?
What do you want?

I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you is not enough for me

This inconsistency,what does it mean?
You got me questioning the way you act
I take it back, do I mean anything?
Just tell me honestly

You say, you want all of me today
But tomorrow's not the same
My feelings never change
What do you want from me?
What do you want?

I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you is not enough for me

Are you playing me?
Is this a game?
When you show up late
Say ""love"" at 2 am
Then tell me you can't stay, girl, yeah
What do you want from me?

Baby oh, I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad, baby
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me"
Rock,"Feeling radical in cotton
Purified in my Satin
But the bomb of the season
Is a velvet revolution
I look at the sky
And feel the tears of the prophets crying
I look at the sky and feel the rain
Their reign of tears

Feeling radical in cotton
Purified in my Satin
But the bomb of the season
Is a velvet revolution
All you killers of the children
There's a new commandment
The true divine creator
Wants a velvet revolution

All you killers of the children
There's a new commandment
The true divine creator
Wants a velvet revolution"
Pop,"I'm going under, and I fear this time there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to knowsomebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and I fear this time there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to held, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all

Rock,"Nobody Feels Any Pain
Tonight As I Stand Outside the Rain
Everybody Knows That Baby's Got New Clothes
But Lately He Sees Her Ribbons and Her Bows
Have Fallen From Her Curls

She Takes Just Like a Woman Yes She Does
She Makes Love Just Like a Woman Yes She Does
and She Aches Just Like a Woman
But She Breaks Just Like a Little Girl

Queen Mary She's My Friend
Yes, I Believe That I'll Go See Her Again
Nobody Has to Guess That Baby Can't Be Blessed
Till She Finally Finds Out That She's Like All the Rest
With Her Fog Her Amphetamines and Her Pills

It Was Raining From the First
and I Was Dying There of Thirst
So I Came in Here
and Your Long-time Curse Hurts
But What's Worse Is This Pain in Here
I Can't Stay in Here Ain't It Clear

That I Just Don't Fit
Yes, I Believe It's Time For Me to Quit
When We Meet Again Introduced As Friends
Well Please Don't Let On That You Knew Me When
I Was Hungry and It Was Your World

I Fake Just Like a Woman Yes I Do
I Make Love Just Like a Woman Yes I Do
and I Ache Just Like a Woman
But I Break Yes I Break Like a Little Girl
She Takes Just Like a Woman
She Makes Love
She Makes Love Just Like a Woman

She Aches Just Like a Woman
Oh, But She Breaks Yes She Breaks"
Pop,"Harbours open there doors to the young searching foreigner
Come to live in the light of the big L of liberty
Plains and open skies bill boards would advertise
Was it anything like that when you arrived
Dream boats carried the future to the heart of America
People were waiting in line for a place by the river

Chorus
It was time when strangers were welcome here
Music would play they tell me the days were sweet and clear
It was a sweeter tune and there was so much room
That people could come from everywhere

Now he arrvies with hopes and his heart set on miracles
Come to marry his fortune with a hand full of promises
To find they've closed the door they don't want him anymore
There isn't anymore to go around
Turning away he remembers he once heard a legend
That spoke of a mystical magical land called America

It was time when strangers were welcome here
Music would play they tell me the days were sweet and clear
It was a sweeter tune and there was so much room
That people could come from everywhere

It was time when strangers were welcome here
Music would play they tell me the days were sweet and clear
It was a sweeter tune and there was so much room
That people could come from everywhere

I can feel you watching in the night
All alone with me and were waiting for the sunlight
When I feel cold you warm me
When I feel I cant go on you come and hold me
Its you... and me forever

Sara smile
Wont you smile a while for me, Sara

If you feel like leaving you know you can go
But why dont you stay until tomorrow?
And if you want to be free, all you have to do is say so
When you feel cold, Ill warm you
And when you feel you cant go on, Ill come and hold you
Its you... and me forever

Wont you smile a while for me, Sara

Rock,"They're really rockin' in Boston, Pittsburgh, PA,
Deep in the heart of Texas and 'round the Frisco bay.
All over St. Louis, 'way down in New Orleans,
All the cats gonna dance with sweet little sixteen.

Sweet little sixteen, she's just got to have
About a half a million signed autographs.
Her wallet's filled with pictures, she gets 'em one by one,
She gets so excited, watch her, look at her run.

Oh mommy, mommy, please may I go ?
It's such a sight to see somebody steal the show.
Oh daddy, daddy, I beg of you,
It's all right with mommy, it's all right with you.

'Cause they'll be rockin' on Bandstand, in Pittsburgh, PA

Rock,"Notice here by given
That spring guns and mantraps
To be placed on these premises
So don't trespass over the line on the map
Commissioners for oaths
In the borough of Banbury
Require the owners of rowdy dogs
To keep them on their leads

We don't care because we're all animal lovers
We like to share our lives with them
Required of this song
Is a case for love
When everything else
That keeps us together conspiring to tear us apart

At the point where the sky and the earth touch
Is the head of the Unicorn
Nailed to the wheel in the middle of the town
Is the nightingale alone
Singing ‘where have you put me
I gave no signed consent
I'd rather keep my place here
And put up with your rents'

Because the sun is soft
Like the narcotics sold in Boots

We don't care because we're all animal lovers
We like to share our lives with them
Required of this song
Is a case for love
When everything else
That keeps us together conspiring to tear us apart

Sleeping safe in your bed
A slow motion circular film
Inward looking
The realm of moles
Pressure-cooking in the home

No approvals in the out tray
Not one today
To the city no forever"
Pop,"I was looking for you
And I wish I could know
You'd come to slip away
I would give you a clue
But I just didn't show
That you were meant to stay
While we are getting so lonely
Love is still up there but only
Between the sky and heaven
Nothing can ever compare
To what it's like to be there
Between the sky and heaven
As we keep rushing like crazy

Can we still see it's amazing
Between the sky and heaven
But after all the days of despair
I know I'll meet you up there
Between the sky and heaven
I am waiting for you
And I know you can sense me
Though you're miles and miles away
On this side of the world
I am feeling you too
Without a single word you say
Cause while we are getting so lonely..."

I'm talkin'

I'm hopin that you came back to me
What you gotta do when the well run dry
You gonna run away and hide
I'm gonna run right by your side
For you pretty baby I'd even cry
I'm walkin'

Rock,"This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight

Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
'cause you can never really tell when somebody
Wants something you want too

Heartwrecker, heartwrecker, make me delight
Right is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time

Wants something or wants to stay

Don't take corner boys because they're too easy.

You didn't have to wait for somebody to hit you.

Take my arm, oh honey, I'll walk with you down Broadway.

Rock,"I shall think it a dream tomorrow
I won't believe you returned
That once again I saw and touched you
And you're so unconserned, unconcerned

You must have known that your cruel silence
Would be so hard to bear
And yet you let me wait, you let me wait and
wonder
Neither here nor there, here nor there

I came back with just one intention
For one last look, one last taste of you
Revenge on those who still despise me
And take my own life too

But there's a long and twisted journey
Between this callous thought and deed
And you're a sweeter way to give me
All the things I need

Two ambitions coincidind
Will only happen now and then
Never hope or dream tomorrow
Will restore your faith again
Never hope or dream tomorrow
Will restore your faith again

How I hope it's no dream tomorrow
But I'm scared the light will fade
And today will be a vague recollection
Just a fool's escapade, escapade

I never cared much about the future
Yesterday was always there
So when you give me hope, hope or a promise
It just isn't fair, isn't fair

Any plan, any calculation
Any plot or device at all
Runs into another's dream
Runs into a wall

No matter what premeditation
In our three score years and ten
There are only fractured moments
We'd want to live again

Two ambitions coinciding
Will only happen now and then
Never hope or dream tomorrow
Will restore your faith again
Never hope or dream tomorrow
Will restore you faith again"

You're about to lose your life
and here I am dejected
'cos I love a night of sleep.

Love one another you said
come together as one.
I'm just a servant, Lord
yet you made me a son
Sometimes I'm troubled
by the things you make me see.
But no matter how I feel, Lord
here am I send me.

So I leave the world behind me
and enter this domain.
I'm staggered by the gulf
between us.
I can see your sickness

Spotting a flying saucer hovering above Big Ben

Grabbing a latte in a coquelicot beret

Must stay anonymous for now
Yes, that hippopotamus
Must stay anonymous for now

Temptation Whoa... Must be Temptation

Too far to fall but we always do
Though we swore in our hearts to be true
You say that hand that your holdin' feels a little cold sometime
Baby sooner or later, you're gonna find that true love..

Is just like Temptation, Whoa... Temptation

Now listen here... Whoa... Temptation
Whoa... Temptation Whoa....

We want it all and we want it fast
No time to think, no time to ask
But you know that road that we're on don't always lead to happiness

Rock,"Where Do We Go From Here

Someone give you their heart
But you still throw it all away
Knowing the past is a part
Part of what you are today
We all know you have your troubles
We all know you have your days
What is love, you can throw it all away
With the helplessness of your pride
Telling yourself you're a loser
Like someone winning who's not
Telling yourself you're a loser
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here

Someone showed you the way
To be ready to see
That the game had been played
Losers had lost
And the winners were free
We all know you have your troubles
We all know you have your ways
What is love, you can throw it all away
With the helplessness of your pride
Telling yourself you're a loser
Like someone winning who's not
Telling yourself you're a loser
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here

We all know you have your troubles
We all know you have your days
What is love, you can throw it all away
With the helplessness of your pride
Telling yourself you're a loser
Like someone winning who's not
Telling yourself you're a loser

When my eyes are closed
I'm remembering how it use to go
Over medicated
Nearly comatose
Going out of your head
YOU'RE STILL ON that road

So whats in your mind when you kill more than time
You're sinking so low thinking you will be high
Biting your lip while you're losing your mind
Alone, God knows

You're climbing up the walls, the walls, the walls
You're climbing up the walls, the walls, the walls
You're just climbing up the walls, the walls, the walls
You're climbing up the walls, the walls, the walls

Now you're reaching that age
Where you should know
How to figure it out
Out on your own
On the far side of town
Is a room you love
Started tearing it down
Thinking you'd follow

So whats in your mind when you kill more than time
You're sinking so low thinking you will be high
Biting your lip while you're losing your mind
Alone, God knows

You're climbing up the walls, the walls, the walls
You're climbing up the walls, the walls, the walls
You're just climbing up the walls, the walls, the walls
You're climbing up the walls, the walls, the walls

THE ROAD WON'T RISE AND EASE YOUR CRYING
If you do nothing, if you do nothing
The world won't try and change your mind
If you don't change it at all

THE ROAD WON'T RISE AND EASE YOUR CRYING

Pop,"Sat on my bed and looked in my eyes
Saw I was grieving for some other time
Stood on my breath and moved close to say
Oh won't you love me lets walk out to play

Ooh we caught the moon from the sky
And wrapped it up with the love that we found in our eyes
And if the words don't tell me you love me
And if the night won't hold us as one
Now there is nothing left that can numb me
Do you love me or do I run

Why don't you ask me to stay?
Ask me to stay

Looked so surprised when she said to me
Can you move the mountain then we can both see
She fell in my arms then I melted away
She said why don't you ask me ask me to stay?

Ooh we caught the moon from the sky
And wrapped it up with the love that we found in our eyes
And if the words don't tell me you love me
And if the night won't hold us as one
Now there is nothing left that can numb me
Do you love me or do I run

She picked up the pillow and laid down her head
We were loving like good friends again
Why don't you touch me, like we used to know
Move over and love me or let me go

And if the words don't tell me you love me
And if the night won't hold us as one

And if the words don't tell me you love me
And if the night won't hold us as one
Now there is nothing left that can numb me
Do you love me or do I run

Why don't you ask me to stay
Ask me to stay

As first you make a wish and pray that things will never change
And then we reach the point of being just good friends again"

""I am as constant as the northern star.""
and I said, ""Constantly in the darkness
where's that at?
If you want me I'll be in the bar.""
On the back of a cartoon coaster
in the blue T.V. screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh Canada
with your face sketched on it twice.

In my blood like holy wine
you taste so bitter and so sweet
well, I could drink a case of you, darling
and I would still be on my feet
I would still be on my feet.

Oh I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid.
I remember that time you told me
""Love is touching souls""
Surely you touched mine
'Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time.

My blood
my holy wine
tastes so bitter and so sweet
Well I could drink a case of you, darling
and I would still be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your devils and your deeds
and she said, ""Go to him, stay with him
but be prepared to bleed""

My blood
my holy wine
tastes so bitter and so sweet
Well I could drink a case of you, darling

I would still be on my feet"

It's a boring macho trip

And I'm the type that facinates

You're twenty eight years
and your face has been lifted

But you still look so much older
You been desoiled and
your linen is drab,
You've got crabs

The things they sell you
Your credit cards
I love you for it
I love you for it
Sell your sugar

Searching high and low
Looking for my way

That shimmers in the sun
And now I know
My life has just begun
You are the sweetest thing
That could ever, ever be
And you're a miracle to me
You fill my life
With tenderness and harmony
I never thought
That I'd be laughing once again
You fill the room
With something warm and wonderful
I can't imagine life
Without your precious love
You're just a rose
That shimmers in the sun
And now I know
My life has just begun
You are the sweetest thing
That could ever, ever be
And you're a miracle to me
Rivers bend rivers flow
Till the end of time
They keep flowing
Through eternity
Take me there
Sail away
Take me to the sea
You're a river that flows inside of me
You're just a rose
That shimmers in the sun
And now I know
My life has just begun
You are the sweetest thing
That I could ever, ever see
And you're a miracle to me"
Pop,"City limits never change
Whispers keep me hunted
Although I challenge everything
I remain captivated

Trying to leave this life behind
I have become the hunter
Now I'm planning my attack
And I will surely rise again

Running from yourself isn't gonna save you

I don't need this, I don't need you
I'm hitting back for what you put me through
I'm over this, I'm over you
I'm taking back what I have given you
I don't need this, I don't need you
I'm taking back what I have given you
I'm over this, I'm over you
I'm hitting back for what you put me through

I don't need this
I don't need you
I don't need this
Don't need you

Tell me have we discovered me
And everything I wanted
Now I'm standing here alone
You're presence haunts me

I have the strength to overcome
And introduce the fighter
No longer hidden in myself
Inflicted pain and mysery

Running from yourself isn't gonna save you

I don't need this, I don't need you
I'm hitting back for what you put me through
I'm over this, I'm over you
I'm taking back what I have given you
I don't need this, I don't need you
I'm taking back what I have given you
I'm over this, I'm over you
I'm hitting back for what you put me through

Am I lying to myself
Is it wrong, is it right
Trying to hard to impress
I wanna belong, feel alright
Am I lying to myself
Am I wrong, am I right
Running from yourself, is never gonna save you

I don't need this, I don't need you
I'm hitting back for what you put me through
I'm over this, I'm over you
I'm taking back what I have given you
I don't need this, I don't need you
I'm taking back what I have given you
I'm over this, I'm over you
I'm hitting back for what you put me through

I don't need this
I don't need you
I don't need this
Don't need you"
Pop,"If I just push him out of my head
I think that I could forget
I won't think about him, not even once
Oh, I'll just push him out of my head

It'll feel like we never met
I'll erase every word you said
I won't think about him, I won't even try
It'll be like we never met

And I
I'll forget

The sound of this laugh
The way that he smiles
The things that he said and those perfect brown eyes
The way that I fell when he looks right at me
I just don't think about it
I just won't think about him

All of those things he said
I'll pretend like they never happened
I won't feel a thing, no
I won't even cry over all of those things he said

And I
I'll forget

The sound of this laugh
The way that he smiles
The things that he said and those perfect brown eyes
The way that I fell when he looks right at me
I just don't think about it
I just won't think about him

I just don't think about him
I just don't think about him

If I just push him out of my head
I'll forget

The sound of this laugh
The way that he smiles
The things that he said and those perfect brown eyes
The way that I fell when he looks right at me
I just don't think about it
I just won't think about him"
Rock,"Iâ€™ve been watching you from the corner of my eye
I canâ€™t stand it, be too close, canâ€™t stand it
Be too far and I canâ€™t say why, yeah
And as the shadow fades
Where you walk away
My secretâ€™s written all across my face

I only want you near me
I only want you near me
Tonight, tonight
I only want you near me
I only want you near me
Tonight, ohh

Oh, Iâ€™ve been watching you from the corner of the sea
You are silent
Eyes of eyes
You are silent
Hands of hands
And I want them both on me
But in the quiet strain
The mention of your name
And Iâ€™m running from you
And running to you all the same

I only want you near me
I only want you near me
Tonight, tonight
I only want you near me
I only want you near me
Tonight, oh tonight
I only want you near me
I only want you near me
Tonight
Round and round we go
The shadows dance by so slow
But only for me to know

I only want you near me
I only want you near me
Tonight, oh tonight
I only want you near me
I only want you near me
Tonight, oh tonight
I only want you near me
I only want you near me
Tonight
Hey yeah

I only want you near me
"
Pop,"I woke up just to miss ya
I woke up just to check if my phone would start to whisper
You said you needed time
So, I made the clock move quicker
Honestly, you were my only friend

I hate to say: I need ya
Look for you in everyone and all it does it feed the
Urge to call you up, so I made myself delete ya
Jenny said: It's the right thing to do

Tell me, is it loud where you are, dear?
There's a silence here
Where are you anymore?

'Cause there's a u shaped space
Where your hands used to be
Baby, there's a pillowcase
Where you lay next to me
It's 3 Am
You know, I know
Can't cure the vacancy
Oh, baby
There's a u shaped space
Where your hands used to be

Tell me, is it loud where you are, dear?
There's a silence here
Where are you anymore?

'Cause there's a u shaped space
Where your hands used to be

Rock,"She'll let you in her house
If you come knockin' late at night
She'll let you in her mouth
If the words you say are right
If you pay the price
She'll let you deep inside
But there's a secret garden she hides

She'll let you in her car
To go drivin' 'round
She'll let you into the parts of herself
That'll bring you down
She'll let you in her heart
If you got a hammer and a vise
But into her secret garden, don't think twice

You've gone a million miles
How far'd you get
To that place where you can't remember
And you can't forget

She'll lead you down a path
There'll be tenderness in the air
She'll let you come just far enough
So you know she's really there
She'll look at you and smile
And her eyes will say
She's got a secret garden
Where everything you want
Where everything you need
Will always stay
A million miles away"
Rock,"My face coming down in streaks
All alone with your things, the apartment still ringing
Clear up and make my start
Not the way I hoped for
Well, welcome to New York

Nothing movie-like
Nothing magic
People just tire to fight the constant battle
Waiting to see a sign?
Then you've seen the best already

The train comes at 1:15
He said: ""Maybe I'll leave. Give you time... let you think.""
Don't know just what he wants
I'm all that I've got
But this time, I'm on it

Nothing movie-like
Nothing magic
People just tire to fight the constant battle
Waiting to see a sign?
Then you've seen the best already
Then you've seen his best already

This time believe it
Believe me
This time you'd better believe it
You know I'm gone"
Rock,"Little girl in these changing times
You got to move on or left behind
Every day is a battle again
And the state of future looks so damned
allright
And if you get it right
Well you just got to fight for what you want
You got to fight for what you want 2x
For what you want
Every guide (or better ’guy’? ) leaves you so confused
... which way to turn

Oh yeah ...
All night ...
with that stone

Remember that
You got to fight for what you want 3x
For what you want

Got to fight for what you want
You got to fight for what you want"
Pop,"I'm tired of closing my eyes, to picture you in my mind
It feels so cold to be alone
Not sure where I want to be, so close to finding my dream
We need to hold on to all the times we spoke of love
Now I pray to God above that someday I can find the door
I'm looking for

I can make it, I know I can
I can save this love forever
I can make I know I can
We can make this work together

It's not a lonely men's dream,it's just that now that there's been
A taste of love in my life
That I refuse to return, I've got so much to learn
How can it feels as though I've reached the top of this steep hill
For a moment I was standing still
Now I have the faith I've needed to believe

'Cause you knop what this love means to me
You know how it feels when I can see it in your face
That you're missing me now, you feel I've let you down
You've gotta hold on, you've gota reach out and believe

I can make this world a place for me and you
We can make it, we can make it together
"
Rock,"Things aren't what they seem
I'm always drifting into dream
It's just a silly scene
everything I do ends up in dream

But it's not what you say and you do
that makes it look hard of what your feelin'
It's just what you say to do
that makes me feel like your head is real and down

Oh, and love makes you feel, oh, ten foot tall
Oh, and love makes you feel ten foot tall

It's not a funny scene
but I'm always drifting, oh, into dreams, ah
It's not a love affair
but I'm just drifting into air

But it's not what you say and you do
oh, that makes it seem like a certain party
It's just all of that you do
that makes me feel that you kidding, way too smart

Oh, and, love makes you feel ten foot tall
Oh, and love makes you feel ten foot tall
like this

'Cause love makes you feel ten foot tall
'Cause love makes you feel ten foot tall
"
Pop,"I'm a traveling man
Made a lot of stops, all over the world
But in every part, I own the heart
Of at least one lovely girl

I have a pretty senorita
Waiting for me
When I get back to LA
And all the girls that I ran through
When I was in cancun
I still don't know their names

Oh my georgia beach down in ATL
Calls me everyday
And my brooklyn girl back in NYC meets me at JFK

Pretty pouerto rican baby I met at the bar
I remember the time
I left the studio late
But you fixed me a plate
And then you let me spend the night

Ohh I'm a traveling man
Yes I'm a traveling man
Ohh I'm a traveling man"
Rock,"Somebody's got to help me
this girl's drivin' me insane
Cause some they likes it hot, and some they likes it cold
and some they just don't like it at, like it at all now

Somebody's got to help me
this girl's drivin' me insane
Now somebody she's got to help me
It makes me feel like, ah, that I'm nowhere at all
It makes me feel like I'm nowhere at all

Somebody's got to help me
this girl's got me on the line now
Cause some they likes it hot, and some they likes it cold
and some they just don't like it at, like it at all now

Somebody's got to help me
this girl's drivin' me insane
Somebody's got to help me
She makes me feel like, I'm nowhere at all
It makes me feel like I'm nowhere at all

I'm nowhere at all
I'm nowhere, give it to me now
I'm nowhere at all now
No honey, Rocky don't know it at all
I'm no, no, nowhere at all
I'm nowhere at all now
oh, give it to me now
"
Rock,"If your heart is restless from waiting too long
When you're tired and weary, and you can't go on
Well if a distant dream is a callin' you
Then there's just one thing that you can do

Yeah, you gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead you
You gotta follow that dream to find the love you need

Now baby, I walk in dreams
And I talk in dreams
I need someone with a love I can trust
And together we'll search for the things that come to us
In dreams, baby in dreams

And I'm gonna follow that dream wherever that dream may lead me
I'm gonna follow that dream to find the love I need

Now every man has the right to live
The right to a chance to give what he has to give
The right to fight for the things he believes
For the things that come to him in dreams

Baby in dreams, I walk in dreams
I talk in dreams
I live in dreams
"
Pop,"I've been happy all alone,
Was content with the world on my own.
Satisfied with, knowing one day,
That the perfect one for me would come along.

Oh, and then came you,
Talkin' to me,
Saying things I wish my ears never heard,
Even though I felt the same way,
I can not allow my feeling to go on, oh.

Cuz it's not the way I planned it to be,
This was not about you coming here and falling for me,
Well you only hear it digitally, oh,
See as bad as I do want you it's just not the way that it should be.

Just imagine, what would happen,
If she only knew how you really feel,
I get chills just thinking of you,
Cuz I know how I would feel if it were me.

Oh, tell me what were you thinkin',
When you selfishly walked into my life,
Never have I, been so lost and confused,
One thing I know for sure is that I can't be with you.

Cuz it's not the way I planned it to be,
This was not about you coming here and falling for me,
Well you only hear it digitally,
See as bad as I do want you it's just not the way that it should be.

Maybe it's too much for just an ordinary girl,
Maybe I'm old-fashioned in my own simple world,
I know I'll always dream about the moment that we shared,
This is how I feel it should be.

Cuz it's not the way I planned it to be,
This was not about you coming here and falling for me,
Well you only hear it digitally,
See as bad as I do want you it's just not the way that it should be"
Rock,"There's a light
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be lived with you
Lived with you
There's a way everybody say
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you, ain't got ?
You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like

To love somebody
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

In my brain
I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
And I'm blind, so very blind
I'm a man, can't you see
What I am
I live and breathe for you
But what good does it do
If I ain't got you, ain't got ?"
Pop,"I got my sight set on you, and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were something special
When you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again

I've got a way of knowing when something is right
I feel like I must have known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes
Now I can't wait to see you again

The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I stu-stu-stuttered when you asked me
What I'm thinkin' about
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend lesley said
""She's just being' miley""
Then next time we hang out
I will redeem myself
My heart can rest till then
Whoa, whoa why?
I can't wait to see you again

I got this crazy feeling deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader
But I'm reading the signs (but can't wait)
That you can't wait to see me again

The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I stu-stu-stuttered when
You asked me what I'm thinkin' about
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend lesley said
""She's just bein' miley""
And next time we hang out
I will redeem myself
My heart can rest till then
Whoa, whoa why?
I can't wait to see you again!

I got my sight set on you
And I'm ready to aim

The last time I freaked out

Rock,"hello Mr Zebra
can I have your sweater
cause it's cold cold cold
in my hole hole hole
Ratatouille Strychnine
sometimes she's a friend of mine
with a gigantic whirlpool
that will blow your mind

hello Mr Zebra
ran into some confusion with a Mrs Crocodile
furry mussles marching on
she think's she's Kaiser Wilhelm
or a civilised syllabub
to blow your mind
figure it out
she's a goodtime fella
she got a little fund to fight for Moneypenny's rights
figure it out
she's a goodtime fella
too bad the burial was premature she said
and smiled

Rock,"When the lights go down
In the California town
People are in for the evening

I jump into my car
And I throw in my guitar
My heart beatin' time with the breathing

Driving over Kanan
Singing to my soul
'Cause people out there turn the music into gold

My buddy Jim Bash
He is working pumping gas
And he makes two fifty for an hour

He's got rhythm in his hands
As he's tapping in the cans
Sings rock and roll in the shower

California girls are the prettiest in the world
Each one a song in the making
Singin' rhymes with me, I can hear the melody
Story is there for the taking."
Rock,"When I love you, do you feel it
I know it makes you happy
When I say all right
When I love you, do you feel it

When I hold you we're an island
You know it makes me happy
When you say all right
When I hold you we're an island

* I know the road's a hard one
But it's easy when you're not alone
So help me to remember, please
Lady, I believe we'll get home

When I love you, do you feel it
You know it makes me happy
When you say all right
When I love you, do you feel it

(* Repeat)

When I love you, do you feel it
You know it makes me happy
When you say all right
When I love you we're an island

I know the road's a hard one
But it's easy when you're not alone
Help me to remember
Lady, I believe we'll make it home
Get home"
Rock,"She can do anything at all
About anything she pleases
If I were to change what she thinks is wrong
What could she want with me?


But wait just one minute here
I can see that she's trying to read me
Suddenly I know


She's going to change the world
But she can't change me
No she can't change me


She has the daylight at her command
She gives the night its dreams
She can uncover your darkest fear
And make you forget you feel it


But wait just one minute more
I can see that she's trying to free me
Suddenly I know


She's going to change the world
But she can't change me


Suddenly I can see everything that's wrong with me
But what can I do?
I'm the only thing I really have at all


But wait just one minute here
I can see that she's trying to need me
Suddenly I know


She's going to change the world
But she can't change me
No she can't change me

Rock,"I'm home, lost my job, and incurably ill
You think this is easy, realism
I've got a girl out there, I suppose
I think she's dancing
Feel like Dan Dare lies down
I think she's dancing, what do I know?

I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh no

I am a D.J., I am what I play
I got believers (kiss-kiss)
Believing me, oh

One more, weekend, of lights and evening faces
Fast food, living nostalgia
Humble pie or bitter fruit

I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around no, ooh

I am a D.J., I am what I say
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, ooh

I am a D.J., I am what I play
I've got believers (kiss-kiss)
Believing me

I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no (kiss-kiss)

Time flies when you're having fun
Break his heart, break her heart
He used to be my boss and millions of puppet dancer
I am a D.J., and I've got believers

I've got believers
I've got believers
I've got believers in me
I've got believers
I am a D.J., I am what I play

Rock,"I'm not in love, so don't forget
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made

I'm not in love, no no, it's because

I'd like to see you, but then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you, don't make a fuzz
Don't tell your friends about the two of us

I'm not in love, mmmm, it's because

I keep your picture upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain still lying there
It hides a nasty stain still lying there

I keep your picture upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain still lying there
It hides a nasty stain still lying there

So don't you ask me to give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me

I'm not in love, mmmm, it's because

Ooh, you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh, you'll wait a long time
Ooh, you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh, you'll wait a long time

I'm not in love, so don't forget
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made

I'm not in love, I'm not in love"
Rock,"Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers
The Last DJ
By Tom Petty

Well, you can’t turn him
Into a company man
You can’t turn him into a whore
And the boys upstairs
Just don’t understand anymore
The top brass don’t like him
Talking so much
And he won’t play
What they say to play
And he don’t want to change
What don’t need to change
There goes the last dj
Who plays what he wants to play
And says what he wants to say
Hey, hey, hey
There goes your freedom of choice
There goes the last human voice
There goes the last dj
Some folks say they’re gonna
Hang him so high
‘Cause you just can’t do what he did
There’s some things you just can’t
Put in the minds of those kids
As we celebrate mediocrity
All the boys upstairs want to see
How much you’ll pay for
What you used to get for free
There goes the last dj
Who plays what he wants to play
And says what he wants to say
Hey, hey, hey
There goes your freedom of choice
There goes the last human voice
There goes the last dj
Well, he got him a station
Down in mexico
Sometimes it’ll kinda come in
And i’ll bust a move and
Remember how it was back then
There goes the last dj
Who plays what he wants to play
And says what he wants to say
Hey, hey, hey
There goes your freedom of choice
There goes the last human voice"

Rock,"Well I'm so tired
Of falling in love
Finding it easier to fall out
You can't deny it
I feel it inside Cupid's fire
I can't hide

But I'm falling in love again
Ain't nothing I can do
Falling in love again
Girl this time it's with you
When I fall
It's always the same
And I'm so tired
Of playing this game

It's been so long now
Since I gave up my heart
I've kept it locked down
I don't wanna get it harmed
So let me tell you now
I just want to be sure
That you won't hurt me
Can you promise me that

Because I'm falling in love again
Ain't nothing I can do
Falling in love again
Girl this time it's with you
When I fall
It's always the same
And I'm so tired
Of playing this game

You got to tell me
If you're going to break my heart
Cause' I don't wanna take the chance
And if it ain't true
All it's gonna be is nothing
But a poor romance
So, give me that promise or hold on now
And I'll never let you go
I gotta have something go on,
Or I'm letting you know now

Falling in love again
ain't nothing I can do
Falling in love again, girl
And this time it's with you
When I fall
It's always the same
And I'm so tired
Of playing this game, yeah

Falling in love again (repeat)"

In a dark room, you and me touchin'
Just you and I, you and I, hey
Starting over
Then the beat comes out of nowhere
Every time this night is over
It's you and, you and I

Hearts will break
We'll make mistakes
But it's okay
But that don't ever stop us from living the high life
From bad times
The hello's, the goodbye's
After all this time, I still go hard for you
And you know we make up, and we fight
We give up, then we try
You're mine for a lifetime
I still go hard (I still go hard for you)

Rock,"""Lie, lie, lies everywhere,"" said the father to the son
Your peppermint breath gonna choke 'em to death,
Daddy watch your little black sheep run
He got a knives in his back ev'ry time he opens up
You say, ""he got be strong if he wanna be a man""
Mister i don't know how you can have

Sweet dreams, sweet dreams

Land, land of liberty
We're run by a constipated man
When you live in the past
You refuse to see when your
Daughter come home nine months pregnant
With five billion points of light
Gonna shine 'em on the face of your friends
They got the earth in a sling
They got world on her knees
They even got your zipper between their teeth

Sweet dreams, sweet dreams

You say, you say, you say that you have 'em
I say that you're a liar
Sweet dreams, sweet dreams

Go on, go on, go on and dream
Your house is on fire
Come along now

Well, well, summer wind been catching up with me
""elephant mind, missy you don't have
You forgettin' to fly,
Darlin', when you sleep""
I got a hazy, lazy susan
Takin turns all over my dreams
I got lizards and snakes runnin' through my body.
Funny how they all have my face

Sweet dreams, sweet dreams"
Pop,"It's been a long night
And we've both had a bit too much

You're trying to kiss me and touch me

Rock,"The morning sun touched lightly on the eyes of Lucy Jordan
In a white suburban bedroom in a white suburban town
As she lay there 'neath the covers dreaming of a thousand lovers
Till the world turned to orange and the room went spinning round.

At the age of thirty-seven she realised she'd never
Ride through Paris in a sports car with the warm wind in her hair.
So she let the phone keep ringing and she sat there softly singing
Little nursery rhymes she'd memorised in her daddy's easy chair.

Her husband, he's off to work and the kids are off to school,
And there are, oh, so many ways for her to spend the day.
She could clean the house for hours or rearrange the flowers
Or run naked through the shady street screaming all the way.

At the age of thirty-seven she realised she'd never
Ride through Paris in a sports car with the warm wind in her hair
So she let the phone keep ringing as she sat there softly singing
Pretty nursery rhymes she'd memorised in her daddy's easy chair.

The evening sun touched gently on the eyes of Lucy Jordan
On the roof top where she climbed when all the laughter grew too loud
And she bowed and curtsied to the man who reached and offered her his hand,
And he led her down to the long white car that waited past the crowd.

At the age of thirty-seven she knew she'd found forever

Pop,"You are the answer to my lonely prayer
You are an angel from above
I was so lonely till you came to me
With the wonder of your love.

I don't know how I ever lived before
You are my life, my destiny
Oh my darling, I love you so
You mean everything to me

If you should ever, ever go away
There would be lonely tears to cry
The sun above would be never shine again
There would be teardrops in the sky

So hold me close and never let me go
And say our love will always be
Oh, my darling, I love you so
You mean everything to me

So hold me close and never let me go
And say our love will always be
Oh, my darling, I love you so
You mean everything to me

Pop,"I live my life in chains
Got my hands in chains
And I can't stick with the cards
That I got with a deal
Like this I must insist
That a girl's got more to do
Then be the way you think a woman should
I'm taking it into my own hands
In this man's land I can understand
Why I'm taking command
Had enough of stuff
And now it's time to think about me, me yeah


And you can easily gamble your life away
Second after second
And day by day
You play the game or you walk away
It's a new turn on a blue day
And a cool deal of life for me
And it's all good

[Chorus]

I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

[Verse 2:]

I've always played it safe nothing's ever safe
Give me the courage to back my own convictions
Every decision I make I pay it back and more
Now turn the cards and let them fall to me
Cos I don't need to play on with the hand that they have given me
I'll give it back cos it's not the way it has to be


And you can easily gamble your life away
Second after second
And day by day
You play the game or you walk away
It's a new turn on a blue day
And a cool deal of life for me
And it's all good

I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

That's not the shape
The shape of my heart
My heart
That's not the shape of my heart

And you can easily gamble your life away
Second after second
And day by day
You play the game or you walk away
It's a new turn on a blue day
And a cool deal of life for me
And it's all good

Pop,"Nigh skies and headlights
Backwards hats and light eyes
Pretty words and white lies
Yeah that's my world tonight
I'm gona and he knows
I lean back he's pulling me close
My heartbeat warms me not to go
I never was good as listening though

He's wearing his favorite hat
And he's thinking his hair looks bad
No no it never does
But I think I'll keep that to myself
He knows I like to go to bed early
But still he's keeping me
Up up up

This feeling's getting stronger
And I can't hold off any longer
I know you feel that spark
You can see it in the dark
So hit me with that smile
And make it stronger
Make it stronger
Make it, make it stronger
Make it stronger
Make it, make it stronger

I said I won't fall
But you didn't help at all
You hold my hand as we walk
And you always open my door
Your tires on this road
You sing loud and miss all the notes
Drew on my car window
Left that behing so I know
You're wearing me down
I tried to keep these feelings out
But look at me now
I lost the fight

This feeling's getting stronger
And I can't hold off any longer
I know you feel that spark
You can see it in the dark
So hit me with that smile
And make it stronger
Make it stronger
Make it, make it stronger
Make it stronger
Make it, make it stronger

Even the moon looks a little brighter
I know I won't be getting any seep tonight
You smile and I'm a goner
Hust give me that feeling and
Make it stronger

Make it stronger
Make it, make it stronger
Make it stronger
Make it, make it stronger

This feeling'sgetting stronger
And I can't hold off any longer
I know you feel that spark
You can see it in the dark
So hit me with that smile

Rock,"Stay away from the future
Back away from the light
It's all deranged - no control

Sit tight in your corner
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged - no control

If I could control tomorrow's haze
The darkened shore wouldn't bother me
If I can't control the web we weave
My life will be lost in the fallen leaves

Every single move's uncertain
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

I should live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
You've gotta have a scheme
You've gotta have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man

No control

Stay away from the future
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

Forbidden words, deafen me
In memoriy, no control
See how far a sinful man
Burns his tracks, his bloody robes
You've gotta have a scheme
You've gotta have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man

I should live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
No control I can't believe I've no control

I can't beleieve i've no control
It's all derenged

Rock,"Ooh she's just a broken doll - she ain't no
Use at all - since you've been gone

Ooh she's just a broken toy - she's no ones
Pride and joy - look what you've done

You had her on a string
You made a fool of her
And that's an awful thing
She thought she'd paid her fare
Now you've gone and you just don't care

You can't wind her up - she's a broken doll
You can't wind her up - altough the key fits
You can't wind her up - she's a broken doll
Someone's thrown away all the pieces

Now you've played your wicked game
Don't you feel no shame
Look what you've done!

Now she's just a broken girl while you're
All around the world - having your fun

She had you in her heart
You made a fool of her right from the very start
She thought she'd paid her fare
Now you've gone and you just don't care

You can't wind her up - she's a broken doll
You can't wind her up - altough the key fits
You can't wind her up - she's a broken doll
Someone's thrown away all the pieces

Ooh she's just a broken toy - she's no ones

Rock,"When I saw you at the groccerie store
You were sharin a shopping cart with her
And I couldn’t turn and run away
I didn’t know what to say
You introduced us for the first time
And I had to look her in the eye
But you could not have imagined my surprise
Can’t you see?
You’re leaving me
For an ugly girl
Does she talk about politics?
And all that stuff that used to makes me sick
Does she smoke cigars and stay up late
Oh she’s so great
Does she tell you what you want to hear?
And I bet she could grow a pear
I feel better thinking you`re a queer
It’s not fair
I can’t compare
To an ugly girl
To an ugly girl
Lalalalalala lalalalalalala lalalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalala
Lalalalalala hhahah
Hahaha the jokes on me
I feel jealous and I feel mean
She’s so nice
That it makes up for her face
There’s no way, do you have to keep your eyes closed
Do you have to keep the lights down low?
Oh I bet you wish you had a blind fold
CAN""T (instead of don't) you see you’re leaving me
For an ugly girl
For an ugly girl
She’s an ugly girl
A real ugly girl
Lalalalalalala lalalalalala lalalalalala lalalalalalala
She’s an ugly girl
An ugly girl ahh huhhh

Pop,"I took a pill in Ibiza
To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I, I, I, I know are sad songs
I, I, I, I know are sad songs
I, I, I, I know are sad songs

I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
Cause my name's a reminder
Of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this

Rock,"I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest in a bit field of tall grass.
I lay there in the sun and felt it caressing my face.
As I fell asleep and dreamed,
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie,
And that I was the star of the movie.
This really blew my mind,
The fact that me, an overfed, long-haired, leaping gnome,
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie...
But there I was....

I was taken to a place, the hall of the mountain kings.
I stood high upon a mountain top, naked to the world,
In front of every kind of girl...
There was long ones, tall ones, short ones,
Brown ones, black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones...
Out of the middle, came a lady,
She whispered in my ear something crazy,
She said...

""Spill the wine and take that pearl,
Spill the wine and take that pearl,
Spill the wine and take that pearl,
Spill the wine and take that pearl,""

I thought to myself what could that mean?
Am I going crazy or is this just a dream?
Now, wait a minute,
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere,
So it's all in my head,
And then...I heard her say one more time...

""Spill the wine and take that pearl,
Spill the wine and take that pearl,
Spill the wine and take that pearl,
Spill the wine and take that pearl,""

I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned.
In her hand was a bottle of wine, in the other, a glass.
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass,
And raised it to her lips,
And just before she drank it, she said...

""Spill the wine and take that pearl,
Spill the wine and take that pearl,
Spill the wine and take that pearl,
Spill the wine and take that pearl,""

Pop,"Today I opened up my eyes
And reached to touch your face
But found that you were gone.
Now the tears begin to show,
And now I think I know
What love can do.

Now I realise that baby you're so good for me,
Don't care what other people say,
They say that I could lose my heart,
I don't care, I don't care, feels so good
To have you lay down by my side
And baby it's so clear to see
That you're so good for me.

Oh yes, it was a San Francisco night,
The moments that we shared
Will haunt me constantly.
Oh, was this for real or just a dream,
I guess that love is never what it seems to be.

Now I realise that baby you're so good for me,
Don't care what other people say,
They say that I could lose my heart,
I don't care, I don't care, feels so good
To have you lay down by my side
And baby it's so clear to see
That you're so good for me.

Now I realise that baby you're so good for me,
Don't care what other people say,
They say that I could lose my heart,
I don't care, I don't care, feels so good

And baby it's so clear to see
That you're so good for me,
You're so good for me,
You're so good for me,
You're so good for me baby."

Sometimes I don't know what comes over me

But I try to remember
don't hurt a Woman
Don't hurt a Woman

I was angry, I said things I shouldn't say
I must have lost control
Sometimes something clicks in my head
and I'm not myself anymore

That wasn't me, you can't believe everything you see
let's make believe I never said a word

And I'll try to remember
don't hurt a Woman
Try to remember
don't hurt a Woman

don't hurt a Woman
I'll try to remember

Pop,"I see you every day
I've known you for a while
You always say hello
I love the way you smile

Do you have any idea what seeing you does to me
I can feel you look in my direction, when will you give into me?

I wonder what it would be like
If we turned out the light
I wonder what it would be like
I'm longing for ya, wanna adore ya
Who would be the first to strike
If you stayed the night
I wonder what it would be like to love you

Well don't you think its strange
Fate brought you to my side
(brought you to my side)
I was doing crunches
You were on stationary bike

I had given up on love I'd met too many freaks (met too many freaks)
Ever since I was seventeen I've been on this loosing streak

I wonder what it would be like
(What would it be like)
If we turned out the light
I wonder what it would be like
(What would it be like)
I'm longing for ya, wanna adore ya
Who would be the first to strike
(Who would be the first to strike)
If you stayed the night
I wonder what it would be like to love you
(What would it be like)

You can look at someone and use your imagination
Oh give in (give in), give in (give in) give in to temptation

I wonder what it would be like
(What would it be like)
If we turned out the light
(Turned out the light)
I wonder what it would be like
(What would it be like)
I'm longing for ya, god I adore ya
Who would be the first to strike
(Who would be the first to strike)
If you stayed the night
(You stayed the night)
I wonder what it would be like to love you

I wonder what it would be like
(What would it be like)
If you would hold me tight

I wonder what it would be like
(What would it be like)
To love you, to love you, to love you

Rock,"Hey little girl is your daddy home
Did he go away and leave you all alone
I got a bad desire
I'm on fire

Tell me now baby is he good to you
Can he do to you the things that I do
I can take you higher
I'm on fire

Hey little girl is your daddy home
Did he go away and leave you all alone
I got a bad desire
I'm on fire

Tell me now baby is he good to you
Can he do to you the things that I do
I can take you higher
I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby
edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley
through the middle of my soul

At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
and a freight train running through the
middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
I'm on fire

Ooh, Ooh, I'm on fire"
Rock,"Stay away from me everybody, 'cause I'm in my sin
I said, stay away from me everybody, 'cause I'm in my sin
You know I'm beggin' you, somebody give me my gin.
Stay away from me, unless you wanta big fight
Stay away from me everybody, unless you wanta get involved in a fight
I'll fight the army and the Royal navy if I don't get some gin tonight
Hey, when I'm feeling high, everythings all right
Hey, when I'm feelin' high, everything is really all right
Gin is gonna be my wife for the rest of my life
Give me my gin
I can get a drink of gin, well, almost any old time
I can get myself a drink of gin, yeah,
Yeah, well, almost any old time
If I can't get myself a drink of gin
I guess I'll have to settle for red wine
I said stay away from me, unless you wanta start a fight
Yeah, stay away from me everybody unless you wanta start a big fight
I'll fight the army and the navy if I don't get myself some gin tonight.
Now now now, listen to me baby, hey, stay away from me everybody, 'cause I'm in my sin
Whoa, stay away from me everybody, 'cause I'm in the sin baby
I'll fight the army and the navy
Somebody, somewhere, give me my gin.

"
Rock,"Go go go go now
out of the nest it's time
Go go go now
Circus girl without a safety net
Here here now don't cry
You raised your hand for the assignment
Tuck those ribbons under your helmet
Be a good soldier

First my left foot then my right behind the other
Pantyhose running in the cold

Mother the car is here
Somebody leave the light on
Green limousine for the redhead dancing dancing girl
And when I dance for him
Somebody leave the light on
ust in just in case I like the dancing
I can remember where I come from

I walked into your dream
and now I've forgotten how to dream my own dream
You are the clever one aren't you
Brides in veils for you
We told you all of our secrets
All but one, and don't you even try
The phone has been disconnected

Dripping with blood and with time and with your advice
Poison me against the moon

Mother the car is here
Somebody leave the light on
Black chariot for the redhead dancing dancing girl
He's gonna change my name
Maybe you'll leave the light on
just in just in case I like the dancing
I can remember where I come from

I escape into your escape into
our very favorite fearscape
It's across the sky and across my heart and I
crossed my legs oh my god

First my left foot then my right behind the other
Breadcrumbs lost under the snow

Oo who mother
Oo mother the car is here
Maybe you'll leave the light on
for the for the for the dancing girl
He's gonna change my name
Maybe you'll leave the light
just in case I like the dancing
I can remember where I come come from

Mother mother mother
"
Rock,"We fell in love and I made you the world
I spent all my time tryin' to satisfy you, girl
Just one thing that I can't figure out [?]
Closer I get, farther baby I am out [?]

30 days, 30 days out
Well I'm six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out
30 days, 30 days out
With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt

The roof was leakin' honey where we live
And I'm wonderin' what's that something that you won't give
I started loving you but I gotta stop
You got me mostly waitin' for that other shoe to drop

30 days, 30 days out
You keep me six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out
30 days, 30 days out
With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt

Tried to talk about what's goin' on
You just smile and tell me ""Baby there ain't nothin' wrong""
In your smile there's a sign in red
It said ""Thousand miles of hard road dead ahead""

30 days, 30 days out
Yeah I'm six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out
30 days, 30 days out
With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt

30 days, 30 days out
Well I'm six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out
30 days, 30 days out
With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt

Rock,"Ready steady gonna meet you on the ballroom floor,
Brother Eddie quit your banging on my bathroom door,
After shaving yeah and after three,
I'm after having me some fun you see,
I'm getting ready for the night to come,
And here I come.

CHORUS:
I'm just a hot shot hitting town,
(Have a little fun),
Just a hot shot getting down,
(Ready steady run),
I'm just a hot shot looking around,
(Loving on the run),
I'm having fun.

Get the recognition each and every place I go,
Fashion leader in the cuban heel and pointed toe,
My Italian suit is pressed and clean,
I'm the Latin lover of thelocal scene,
I'm getting ready for the night to come.

CHORUS Repeated.

A faded picture on the mantleshelf,
My older brother looks like myself,
Remember Donny dated Susie,
And Susie rated Johnny,
Johnny's into Susie,
But Susie'a into Ronnie,
Ronnie waits for Louie,
But Louie's singing Louie-Lou-i.

CHORUS Repeated."
Rock,"My heart was so heavy with longing for you
My arms were so lonely, lonesome and blue
Alone in my sorrow, I heard a voice cry
A voice in the wilderness, a voice from the sky

Have faith in your darling, the voice seemed to say
Be true to her memory, she'll come back one day
And though there was no-one, nobody to see
A voice in the wilderness brought comfort to me

We had a quarrel, I was unkind
Why did you leave me, love made me blind
Come back to me darling, I yearn for your touch
Have pity, come back now, I need you so much
Believe me and you'll hear it, the voice from above
The voice in the wilderness, the voice of true love

Believe me and you'll hear it, the voice from above
A voice in the wilderness, the voice of true love."
Rock,"Got to get it together.
Got to get it together.
Got to get it together.
Got to get it together.
Got to get it together.
Get together now, baby.
Got to get it together.
Get it, get it, get it together.
Got to get it together.
I'll tell you right now, get it together.
Got to get it together.
Everybody has to get it.
Got to get it together.

There's few things I must say
I've got some news and it's on my mind
So don't get in my way
I won't be fooled by the things you do

There's a smokescreen baby all around you
Got some of my own, ya

Smokescreen

I work so hard and I treat you right
How can you be so cruel?
I take your baggage on my lovin' heart
Waitin' many times for you

Don't think you foolin me
There's a smokescreen baby all around you
I just can't let you be

Smokescreen

So don't get in my way

Rock,"She cried to the southern wind
About a love that was sure to end
Every dream in her heart was gone
Headin' for a showdown
Bad dreamer, what's your name?
Looks like we're ridin' on the same train
Looks as though there'll be more pain
There's gonna be a showdown

And it's raining all over the world
It's raining all over the world
Tonight, the longest night

She came to me like a friend
She blew in on a southern wind
Now my hеart is turned to stone again
Therе's gonna be a showdown
Save me
Oh, save me
It's unreal, the suffering
There's gonna be a showdown

And it's raining all over the world

They ride down the streets with death in their eyes
And the new world's defeat, baby, it eats your eyes
Come on, come on, let's go tonight
I said come on, come on, let's go tonight

Well a man ...
And he lost his wife
He walks down the streets babe, with death in his eyes

Pop,"The date is going well I think, well everything except
I'm laughing like a lunatic at everything she says
Got ketchup on my trousers
And my cheeks are going red
Tonight I drink wine with the girl I just met

I had to think of things to do
To stop my nervous hands
The label on the bottle never really stood a chance
The salt & pepper pots were getting well into their dance
Tonight I went out with the girl I just met

Tell me all about you
(What a buzz)
Where I'd be without you
(What a buzz)
Tell me all about you
What a beautiful buzz with the girl I might love

I'm staring across the table
At the nicest eyes I've seen
I said they were brown
But she insisted they were green
So I called over the waiter and he told me he agreed
Tonight I drink wine with the girl that likes me
(What a buzz)

Tell me all about you
(What a buzz)
Where I'd be without you
(What a buzz)
Tell me all about you
What a beautiful buzz with the girl I might love

Any time any place
Coast to coast or out of space
You can find the two of us, the young that drunk the love
Tonight we drank wine

So
Tell me all about you
(What a buzz)
Where I'd be without you
(What a buzz)
Tell me all about you
What a beautiful buzz with the girl I might love
(What a buzz)

Tell me all about you
(What a buzz)
Where I'd be without you

Tell me all about you
What a beautiful buzz with the girl I might love

Pop,"It's too damn late to be thinking 'bout
These old mistakes, it's crazy how we're
Up and down, up and down

Time will tell, things have changed
I need you to tell me, baby
Tell me, baby, tell me, babe
Tell me how to see, I gotta know
Either way

'cause I can't wait around for you, you, you
'cause I got too many things to prove, ooh
I think it's time that you choose
What this really means to you
I wish I could read your mind
Just to predict your next move
Yeah 'cause I can't wait around for you, you, you

'cause the good ones will go
If you wait too long
I learned that from my
Favourite song
We're up and down, up and down
I need to know if you're in or out, in or out

Pop,"In the night when the sun goes down
And your wild side comes out
Baby, that's when you shake it for me
Soon as that door's shuts
Turn the bed to a club
Baby, that's when you shake it for me

Fingers on your clothes, girl
I been thinking that you always worked out
Living in la now
But I swear you move like you
Come from the south
When we getting private
You show me tricks you don't show no one else
I wonder where you learned that
Want you to show me

Oh I can tell that you're a pro girl
'cause you do it right
Then you become an other person
When I hit the lights
I could've sworn
You were a dancer in another life
I gotta know, I gotta know

'cause in the night when the sun goes down
And your wild side comes out
Baby, that's when you shake it for me
Soon as that door's shuts
Turn the bed to a club
Baby, that's when you shake it for me
And you go up and you come down
You turn around
And then you poke it out for me
When you get my love and your body erupt
Baby, that's when you shake it for me

Shake it like a tambourine, girl
You see only you do that things you do
In and outta jeans, girl
Makes no difference
To me to see you outta tune
It's gotta be magic
Some type of illusion, baby
I wonder where you learned that
Want you to show me

Oh I can tell that you're a pro girl

[2 chainz]
Yeah, 2 chainz
Turn the bedroom to a nightclub
I got idea, yes a light bulb
Then I lay back, let you get on top
See if you can join the bike club
First you told me you don't like clubs
Unless you see it's the right one
Outta all the girls that left
I'm starting to think you're the right one
We make a movie and sequel
We don't need siskle and eber
I'm like an eagle that's eager
I turn to a beast when I need you
Wait 'til the dark when I see you

'cause in the night when the sun goes down
And your wild side comes out
Baby, that's when you shake it for me
Soon as that door's shuts
Turn the bed to a club

You turn it around and you girl"
Rock,"Daddy’s in the hallway
Hanging pictures on the wall
Mama’s in the kitchen
Making casseroles for all
My brother came home yesterday
From somewhere far away
He doesn’t look like I remember
He just stares off into space
He must’ve seen some ugly things
He just can’t seem to say

God bless this mess
God bless this mess

Got a job in town
Selling insurance on the phone
With Robert and Teresa
And two con men from back home
Everyone I call up doesn’t have the time to chat
Everybody is so busy doing this and doing that
Something has gone missing
And it makes me kinda sad, oh

God bless this mess
God bless this mess
God bless this mess

Heard about the day
that two skyscrapers came down
Firemen, policemen
And people came from all around
The smoke covered the city
And the body count arise
The president spoke words of comfort
With tears in his eyes
Then he led us as a nation
Into a war all based on lies, oh

God bless this mess
God bless this mess
God bless this mess
God bless this mess"
Rock,"They're the Hollywood kids each and every one
With a high class smile and a little baby's tongue
Lonely hard head losers dressed in the tinsel of the times
And learn all the latest lines and the order in which they come
So perfumed sweet and so obscene
Like the fancy dancers of our dirty green
Oh they knew hello and good bye but not what goes in between
Yea and its such a scene on Saturday night

Fifth avenue freaks strait off the racks
They swear you can buy and sell your soul on a good dat outside

They're the Hollywood kids each and everyone
And on Sunday back into their holes they run
And on Monday here I stand alone on this littered stage like an animal who
forgot he was in a cage
Just a restless soul
Just waiting for 'em to come
They're Hollywood kids each and everyone

Rock,"Well she's a brown-eyed lady and I couldn't give her an answer
She took all I give her and all she ever wanted is more
And I'd have to admit that I'm not just a born romancer
Who'll taking it easy, feel like I did before

CHORUS:
Mean, mean Jemima
Won't you come back, won't you come back home?
Mean, mean Jemima
Won't you come back, won't you come back home?

I'm sitting here thinking of nothing but matches and candles
She took all I give her and all she ever wanted is more
And I'd have to admit she was too much for me to handle
Who'll taking it easy, I'm feeling like I did before

She's a brown-eyed lady and I couldn't give her an answer
She took all I give her and all she ever wanted is more

Pop,"Lookin' at your childhood face
On the pillow where you lie
Maybe when a good thing's gone
One is born before our eyes
Standin' here alone in this room with you
All you were before and all you will be, too
Penetrates my lonely, lonely heart
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, this is where we start

Waking to this dream of life
Honey, there's no cause to hide
Risin' like a breath of ease
All the world is on our side
All alone in this room with you
All the things you are and all you will be, too
Penetrates, devastates my lonely heart
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, this is where we start
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, this is where we start

Hand me down my dancing shoes
Hand me down my silver wings
Take me out to town tonight, yes
So I can hear my angels sing
Lying here with you, I raise my eyes
And I pray that time, time, will pass us by
To remain inside the beating of you heart
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, this is where we start
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, this is where we start
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, this is where we start"
Rock,"Some other spring I'll try to love,
Now I still cling to faded blossoms.
Fresh when one left crushed and torn
Like the love affair I'm on.

Some other spring, when twilight falls,
Will the night bring another to me ?
Not your kind will let me find
It's not true that love is blind.

Sun shines around me,
But deep in my heart, it's cold as ice.
Love wants you for me,
But can the story be told twice ?

Some other spring will my heart ring
Stirring to sing love's magic music.
Then forget the old duet
Find love with some other spring.
"
Rock,"As I wake I see the signs that the world's forever changed
If hell on earth could be imagined, it became truth today
Amidst the flames I watched the brave
Sacrificed so lives could be saved
And tears filled my eyes as I watched the world become a grave

I know why you had to go inside
I looked and saw the world change before my eyes
I lift my voice to you
For all you had to do
You're a brother of mine
You're a brother of mine

As the dust settles the ashes fall before the dawn
Our nation watches as the leaders fulfill the reasons they were born
Amidst the pain and anger
A light beacons through all the clouds
A light that shines on the rugged flag and yes
We're united proud and strong

I know that I'll never understand the loss of life
I know I saw the world change before my eyes
I lift my voice to you
A new hope being true
You're a brother of mine
I know my god is true
He will deliver you
You're a brother of mine
You're a brother of mine

We stand on hollowed ground
Where all my brothers lost and found
We're all about the colors of the country you can't kill
The colors of the country you can't kill
We're all about the colors of the country you can't kill

Brother of mine
You're a brother of mine
Brother of mine
You're a brother of mine

I lift my voice to you
For all that we've been through
You're a brother of mine
I know my god is true
He will deliver you
You're a brother of mine
A brother of mine
Brother of mine
You're a brother of mine"

Chorus:
I'm alright tonight
I'm alright
You're alright tonight
You're alright
We're alright tonight
It's alright tonight

You came down
A twisted up road
You've been traveling
For light years
You got here the same time
Those tears found their way
Down your face
I fought with the laws tooth
And nail
And I traveled
By night, dear
You're a sight for sore eyes
I've been looking
All over the place
Up where the angels sigh
Down there the dreams get
Smashed on the rocks
You and I
Wait to begin again
Lifted above by a love
That does not end

Chorus

You picked up some
Pieces of light
As you broke through
The speed of sound
I was rockin' around
In my own
Two-dimensional way
Now when I hear
That jet engine blow
Then I know you are
Leaving town
Baby, I'd follow you
To the edge of it all, anyway
Up where the kingdom comes
Down where the streets
Take the breath
Of another young gun
Love is a whispered prayer
Shot like a spark
Though the heart
Of dark despair

Chorus

I don't regret
Any nineteen-year-old
Indiscretions
I can still fit both my feet
In my mouth, anyway
But these days I'm just not as
Willing to nurse
The obsession
If the doc says
I've got to come out
Then I'm happy to pay

"
Rock,"(trecho)

I'm just a rockstar, stabbin' away
I take that, I'll take the lead for another day
Just let me know if I sing too much

Bring your head over heels
When the magic is there
But impossible

Impossible
Impossible
Just take me away

Impossible
Impossible
There was a? of this marvellous thing

Let's get this show on the road
Let's get atomica
Let's rock 'till we explode
Let's get atomica

Protection from the voices
Protection from the visions
Protection from the silence for another day

'Cause modern people
Are shown on?

When you're head over heels
And the magic is gone
It's impossible, impossible

Impossible
Impossible
Then we should swim in a covered up pool

Impossible
Impossible

Let's get this show on the road
Let's get atomica
Let's rock 'till we explode
Let's get atomica"
Rock,"In the early morning hours there's a din in the air;
mayhem's on the loose.
Stormtroopers comin', and you better be prepared.
Got no time to choose.

Get ready. Stormtroopers comin'.

Comin' up that street, jackboots steppin' high.
Got to make a stand.
Looking in your windows and listen to your phone.
Keep a gun in your hand.

Get ready. Stormtroopers comin'.
Get ready. Stormtroopres comin' around.

Two hundred down, and it's comin' 'round again.
Got no second choice.
Where's the justice and where's that law.
Raise your healthy voice.

Get ready. Stormtroopers comin'.
We'll be ready. Stormtroopers comin'.
Getting ready. Stormtroopers comin'.
Get ready. Stormtroopers comin'."
Pop,"There's a thousand words that I could say,
To make you come home.
Yeah,
Seems so long ago you walked away,
Left me alone.
And I remember what you said to me,
You were acting so strange. (Hmmm)
And maybe I was too blind to see,
that you needed a change.
Was it something I said,
to make you turn away,
to make you walk out and leave me cold.
If I could just find a way...
to make it so that you were right here,
Right now

Chorus

I've been sitting here,
Can't get you off my mind,
I'm trying my best to be a man and be strong
I drove myself insane,
Wishing I could touch your face,
But the truth remains...
You're, Gone, (gone)
Baby, you're gone,
You're, Gone,
Baby Girl, you're gone,
Gone,
You're...

Now I don't want to make excuses baby,
won't change the fact that you're gone (oh no)
But if there's something that I could do
Won't you please let me know,
The time is passing so slowly now,
Guess that's my life without you. (Guess that's my life without you)
And maybe I could change my everyday,
But baby, I don't want to.
So I'll just hang around, and find some things to do,
To take my mind off missing you.
(Take my mind off missing you)
And I know in my heart,
You can't say that you don't love me to,
Please say you do...
(Yeah)

Chorus

I've been sitting here,
Can't get you off my mind,
I'm trying my best to be a man and be strong
I drove myself insane,
Wishing I could touch your face,
But the truth remains...(truth remains...you're)
You're, Gone, (gone)
You're, Gone.
Gone, Gone
You're, Gone,
Gone,
You're, Gone,
You're Gone...

Bridge

What will i do
if I can't be with you
tell me where will i turn to
baby who will I be?
now that we are apart
am I still in your heart?
baby why don't you see?
That I need you here with me..
Ohh-ohhh!

Chorus

I've been sitting here, (sitting here)
Can't get you off my mind, (can't get you off of my mind)
I'm trying my best a man and be strong, (trying my best to be a man)
I've drove myself insane,
Wishing I could touch your face,
But the truth remains...(truth remains)
You're, Gone, (sitting here)
I've drove myself insane,
Wishing I could touch your face,
But the truth remains... (truth remains)
You're, Gone,
You're, Gone.
Baby, you're gone,
But the truth remains...

Rock,"I know that I can be lonely
So stay with me, don’t play with me
Don’t blow out everything
You’ve got to know how I feel
It’s my Achilles heel, feeling lonely

Things never change, but they weaken
And I can’t be, green memory
I’ve got to feel your smile
I feel that I am part of a wheel
It’s my Achilles heel, feeling lonely"
Pop,"It's good to be near you, even though I'm alone
Reviving memories of our happy home
No sign of sunlight since you ran away
These rooms get darker now every day

Even though I have broken
Even though I have broken your heart
Will you still love me?
Will you still love me?

The consequences of freedom
But now you have what you dreamed
Just understand that things are not as they seem

Even though I have broken
Even though I have broken your heart
Will you still love me?
Will you still love me?

I don't wanna be lonely
Because you're not there for me to be
I don't wanna be lonely
I wanna be loved

Even though I have broken
Even though I have broken your heart
Will you still love me?
Will you still love me?
"
Rock,"If you find yourself looking for someone
To make good the bad things that you've done.
Do you think you're looking straight ahead?
And, will you find the answer when you're dead?


Well, then you should listen now to me.
And, I'll tell you how I think it should be.
No one tells you why you're here to live.
This is why it's you who must forgive.


No! You can't kill your brother ...
No! Because you love each other.
No! You can't steal his pennies ...
No! 'Cause you didn't leave him any.


Ahhhhhh ... Ahhhhhh ...
Ahhhhhh ... Ahhhhhh ...


And if reason tells you not to live,
But you feel there's something left to give.
You can't leave this place until it's done,
So you'll see one more rising of the sun.


Sun ...
Sun ... You're gonna' see it one more time.
Sun ... Oh you can't get away from it.
Sun ... You're gonna see it, oh, one more time
"
Rock,"Don't really want to fall out of love,
And baby I need a lovin' shove,
To get back in, Lord, to get back in.
To get back in once again, baby.


Oooo, baby when times are good,
You know they couldn't get no better if they tried to.
But there's a question standing where I stood,
You know you act just like the person that's been lied to.


You ain't been treatin' me like you know you should,
There's been a change in your way.
Remember what it's like when love is good,
And remember the chorus 'cause I wrote it for us.


Don't really want to fall out of love,
And baby I need a lovin' shove,
To get back in, oh, to get back in.
To get back in once again.


You know I love that girl with all my heart,
And, like wine, with age it gets better.
But I don't like trouble, and when trouble starts,
It's the times I wish I could forget her.


If you give 'em an inch, boy, then they'll take a mile,
And gettin' it back's so hard to do.
They'll take advantage of your gentle style,
But you've got to forgive them, 'cause you're tryin' to live with them.


Woah ... woah
Woah, woah ... woah
To get back in, to get back in, to get back in once again.
To get back in, to get back in, to get back in once again, babe.


To get back in ...

Rock,"I wanna live, I wanna give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions that never give
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
They keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

I've been to Hollywood, I've been to redwood
I've crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, its such a fine line,
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
It keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

Keeps me searching for a heart of gold,
Keeps me searching and I'm growing old
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old.

He's got the phone in the car in his hand
Everbody's trying to be a friend of mine
Even a dog can shake hands

He wants twenty percent
'Cause he knew you back when
Now they all want a piece if the band
Everybody's trying to be a friend of mine

All the worms and the gnomes are having lunch at Le Dome
They're all living off the fat of the land
Everbody's trying to be a friend of mine

You'll be making the scene 'til they pick your bones clean
No, they don't leave much for the fans

Pop,"All you folks think you own my life
But you never made any sacrifice
Demons they are on my trail
I'm standing at the crossroads of hell
I look to the left I look to the right
There's hands that grab me on every side
All you folks think I got my price
At which I'll sell all that is mine
You think money rules when all else fails
Go sell your soul and keep your shell
I'm trying to protect what I keep inside
All the reasons why I live my life
Some say the devil be a mystical thing
I say the devil he a walking man
He a fool he a liar conjurer and a thief
He try to tell you what you want
Try to tell you what you need
Standing at the point
The road it cross you down
What is at your back
Which way do you turn
Who will come to find you first
Your devils or your gods
All you filks think you run my life
Say I should be willing to compromise
I say all you demons go back to hell
I'll save my soul save myself"
Rock,"When you're all alone
And you need someone
Telephone and I'll come runnin'
Reconsider me

If the past still makes you down
Darlin', that was then and this is now
Reconsider me

And I'll never make you sad again
'Cause I swear that I've changed since then
And I'll never make you sorry if you try
Let's let bygones be forgotten
Reconsider me
Reconsider me

You can go and be what you want to be
It will be alright if we disagree
I'm the one who cares and I hope you'll see
That I'm the one who loves you
Reconsider me

I promise that I'll never make you cry
I'll never make you sad again"
Pop,"We all need friends
Loving somebody
Don't cost a thing
Don't stop living
Remember your life is a mature may

No more excuses, stand up
Like comes a time in life, is it love?
Time is moving, catch up

Don't get left behind, try to follow your God
You've got the road in front of you

Stop, get ahead, what you've gonna do?

What you've gonna do and when you move...
Don't let it affect, you get better soon
Cause it get better soon (better soon)(2x)
Cause it get better soon, uuuuh, and I know that...

There'll be times where
We don't say What's up?
And we go in circles
Tryin' to keep in touch
We whisper sparking
Between the both of us
Just tell how you feel
Goes a long away

Back out on the road again
I've got a couple of stops to make
No time to calling
It's kinda hard to communicate
I can't let nothing slow me down
I'm battling up with no my feelings up

I've got to turn this all around
Don't know what to stop it
I've got to do it now
You've got the road in front of you

Stop, get ahead, what you've gonna do?

And when you move...

Don't let it affect, you'll get better soon
Cause it get better soon (better soon)(2x)
Cause it get better soon

One day you'll see
We'll be happy
There'll be times where
We don't say What's up?
And we go in circles
Tryin' to keep in touch
We whisper sparking
Between the both of us
Just tell how you feel
Goes a long away

Goes a long away (Goes a long away...)
Which way do I go
Because I'm cut between crossroads
I wish I could star all over again
Move again my heart,
And let a little bit of me go
Cause being my friend (Cause being my friend)
Goes a long away
So hear me say

There'll be times where
We don't say What's up?
And we go in circles
Tryin' to keep in touch
We whisper sparking
Between the both of us (Between the both of us)
Just tell how you feel
Goes a long away...

There'll be times where
We don't say What's up?
And we go in circles
Tryin' to keep in touch
We whisper sparking
Between the both of us (Between the both of us)

Rock,"Sometimes the sun shines
And I close the blinds
'Cos I can't stand to see the light of day
I have no use for pain
But I don't mind the rain
'Cos I can stare outside and hear the sound
Today I looked right down to the ground
With nothing in between to break my fall
I'm blue for you, blue for you
I don't know what to do

CHORUS
Gotta form a plan of attack
Can't stop to look back I know
You are so far from here
Gotta be strong in my mind
Not encroach on your time I know that
That would be wrong for sure

I must get out and about
Of that I have no doubt
There surely must be new places to go
Sights I've never seen
All with pastures green
'Cos the old ones are making me blue for you
'Cos I'm blue for you, blue for you
I don't know what to do
And I'm blue for you, blue for you
I don't know what to do

Gotta form a plan of attack
Climb back on the track I know
Bid my devil friend good-bye
Hope I'm still in the race
But I don't know whaat to chase oh no
And you're still so far from here

The sun it still shines in
And I shall close the blinds
'Cos I know I won't see you anymore, see you anymore
And I'm blue for you, blue for you
I don't know what to do
'Cos I'm blue for you, blue for you
I don't know what to do
I don't know
I could take a big jump

Rock,"I knew a girl named Rosalie,
We used to hang out in the park,
We used to score the system grease,
From the fellas after dark.
We used to sail the streets at night,
Used to hang out late,
She had a bad time in the barrack,
Caught a bullet in the teeth.

Rosalie come go,
Rosalie come stay,
Rosalie come go,
I never liked you anyway.

I knew a girl named Mary Ann,
She had a camera and a cane,
She used to walk me to the station,
When I was dying in the rain.

She was a friend of Rosalie's,
They had a nurse they liked to share,
Well Mary Ann was doing the doctor,
You know his covers went bare.

Rosalie come go,
Rosalie come stay,
Rosalie come go,
I never liked you anyway.

Rosalie come go,
Rosalie come stay,
Rosalie come go,
I never liked you anyway.

I knew a boy named Billy Haynes,
He had it all figured out,
He had a trail of dust and branches marked,
To get him back down south.

But the blue lights had his number,
And he was sweating hard from the heat,
He's got a pack of bullets in his satchel
Down on forty second street.

Rosalie come go,
Rosalie come stay,
Rosalie come go,
I never liked you anyway.

Rosalie come go,
Rosalie come stay,
Rosalie come go,"

Tuesday, made me feel stupid
Wednesday, the world was ours

Saturday, we didn't talk

Am I crazy?
Am I losing hold of all of you baby?
Either you want me or you don't
I need to know

Who are you today?
Will you be the sun or the pouring rain?
Who are you tomorrow?
Will you make me smile or just bring me sorrow?
Who are you gonna be when I'm lost and I'm scared?
Who are you gonna be when there's nobody there?

Can make you feel so right and bring you so much pain
It's so strange how the same face
Can make you love until it hurts

There's a certain magic in your smile
And it's plain to see you've sure got style
Just to be with you I'd walk a thousand miles

Oh, Angie, don't you weep, all your kisses still taste sweet, I hate that sadness in your eyes.

Shopping for a pair of shoes, shopping for a hat
We're buying some of this and we're buying

Hey, don't you worry, everything's alright you know
We're gonna be just fine
If the rain crashes down over you
I will love you dry

There is nobody in this world could ever take me away from you
I am always by your side
If you need someone to guide you dear
I'd like to try

Don't give up something you've never had before
(Never could but we would together)
I promise you this
You're the one I adore

Here it comes again
Filling my soul, never want to let go
Here it comes again
Be at one with your love as below so above

My love is flowing freer than a waterfall
Beyond the edge of time
Surrender to the emotion now we can fly
We can fly
And you know there's a reason
That we are who we are (who we are)
I can not resist
You're the one I adore

Here it comes again
Filling my soul, never want to let go
Here it comes again
Be at one with your love as below so above
Here it comes again

Just like there's always gonna be
A place for you and me
A ship that we can sail on
Just like if one and one were three
And everything was free
At the end of some rainbow
Just like a needle and a gun
A circle in a sun
And a knock upon a hidden door
It is you I adore

Here it comes again
Filling my soul, never want to let go
Here it comes again

Filling my soul, never want to let go

But will you make your home in my arms? ""

Hiding behind rocks to learn if he found a new love

who were torn apart then left broken-hearted
Lorelei hears the cry of lovers
that the sea of fate had separated

Selkie puts her hand in his, he knows the gift she gives
There inside his cabinet, folded safe her seal skin

I've been waiting on the love of my life to find
He's been waiting on his selkie to come back

He said ""I know these shores are not like yours
But will you make your home in my arms? """
Rock,"Oh Tokyo, lived Shintaro
Little koga ninjas tried to take him away
But Shintaro he's not alone
Got Koga ninjas of his own
They help him in the fight
Look out here come the samurai
Gisha girls with silk and curls
Giggle about this guy
They want to comb his pony tail
Become Mrs. Samurai

But he's a fat little jap chap
But don't you tell him that
He might slice you in two
Or get tombay the mist on to you

Oh Tokyo, Lived Shintaro
Oh Tokyo, Lived Shintaro

Oh Tokyo, Oh Tokyo"
Rock,"Fingers in, listen what voices say.
you always wrote for me, ego.
risk worth taking risk worth leaving.
seems i'm still afraid to promise.
too big to stop too big to hold on to.
trade up for the fast ride.
trade your friends.
train passes us.
pulling your teeth you push away.
cancel plans, cancel them all.
check your breath for cold and hold on.
please hold on.
no pictures left to burn good-bye to.
the smell of ash and white walls blank.
phase passes us.
horizontal lines and button up.
the drawers of paper all say one thing.
like music boxes custom made.
time passes us.
don't move.
be still.
be silent.

Pop,"We were lost in the middle
Like bottles in the ocean
But we found one another
Like the answer to a question
Like words to a love song
Like a river to the red sea
Finding you was so hard
But loving you is easy

Loving you is easy
Loving you is easy
Finding you was so hard
But loving you is easy

We were lost in the middle
Like bottles in the ocean
But we found one another
Like the answer to a question
Like words to a love song
Like a river to the red sea
Finding you was so hard
But loving you is easy

Loving you is easy
Loving you is easy
Finding you was so hard
But loving you is easy

Loving you, I've been loving you (6x)
Loving you,
Finding you was so hard

I think i've finally found the one
Here comes a change
I think the change has just begun
I'm not the same
I think i've finally found the one
Here comes a change
I think the change has just begun
I'm not the same
I think i've finally found the one

We were lost in the middle
Like bottles in the ocean
But we found one another

Finding you was so hard
But loving you is easy"
Rock,"I had a friend one time, at least I thought he was my friend
For he came to me, said ""I ain't got no place to go""
I said ""take it easy man, you can come home to my house,
I'll get you a pillow where you can rest your head""
Took him home with me, let him in my house,
Let him drive my Cadillac that I could not afford
When I found out he'd been messin' around with my baby

You know I'm mad like Al Capone (I'm burnin' up)
I said I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
Like Sonny Liston yeah (I'm burnin' up)
You know baby I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
Like Cassius Clay (I'm burnin' up)
You know I'm mad (I'm burnin' up) you know I'm mad
Yeah baby, alright baby (I'm burnin' up)
I'm mad, come on (I'm burnin' up)

Took him home with me, introduced him to my baby,
He began to talk to her, made her think the moon was blue
You know I think I ought to tell you daddy
I'm mad, I said I'm mad with you
I don't know what I'm gonna do to you
I might drown you, I might shoot you
I just don't know because I'm mad

I said I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
You know I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
I don't have to tell you I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
I'm mad with you yeah (I'm burnin' up)
I said I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
Yeah yeah yeah (I'm burnin' up)
I said I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
You know I'm mad, oh baby I'm mad
Oh I said I'm mad, you know I'm mad, oh baby I'm mad
"
Rock,"Who can it be knocking at my door?
Go 'way, don't come 'round here no more.
Can't you see that it's late at night?
I'm very tired, and I'm not feeling right.
All I wish is to be alone;
Stay away, don't you invade my home.
Best off if you hang outside,
Don't come in - I'll only run and hide.

Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?

Who can it be knocking at my door?
Make no sound, tip-toe across the floor.
If he hears, he'll knock all day,
I'll be trapped, and here I'll have to stay.
I've done no harm, I keep to myself;
There's nothing wrong with my state of mental health.
I like it here with my childhood friend;
Here they come, those feelings again!

Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?

Is it the man come to take me away?
Why do they follow me?
It's not the future that I can see,
It's just my fantasy

Oh...Who can it be now?
Oh...Who can it...Who can it...
Yeah yeah yeah

Rock,"Waking, he stared raptly at her face
on his lips, her smell, her taste
Black hair framing her perfect face
with her wonderful mind and her incredible grace

And so, he woke, he woke her with a start
to offer her his heart
for once and for all, forever to keep
And the words, that she first heard him speak
were really very sweet
he was asking her to marry him, and to

Think it over
baby, think it over
Think it over
baby, why don't you think it over

She said, somewhere, there's a faraway place
where all is ordered and all is grace
No one there is ever disgraced
and everyBODY there is wise and everyone has taste

And then she sighed, well la-dee-dah-dee-dah
you and I have come quite far
and we really must watch what we say
Because when you ask for someone's heart
you must know that you're smart
smart enough to care for it, so I'm gonna

Think it over

Pop,"Daddy-o, daddy-o when I close my eyes
There's a cyclone there and I want to rise
An electric train to a long lost world
To a land of a thousand dancing girls

Come to me, my daddy-o
Take me where I want to go
To the world I left behind
To the Coney Island line

Oh daddy-o, daddy-o
Daddy tell me the tale that the captain told
When the lightning flashed and the thunder rolled
We will all be safe, we will be there soon
We will all have fun when we reach the moon

Come to me, my daddy-o
Take me where I want to go
To the moon I left behind
Down the Coney Island line
Oh daddy-o, daddy-o

Daddy-o, daddy-o, can you make me feel
Like the way I did on the Wonder Wheel
Can you love me now as you loved me then
Can you dream that parachute dream again

Come to me, my daddy-o
Take me where I want to go
To the dream I left behind
Down the Coney Island line

Come to me, my daddy-o
Take me where I want to go
To the world I left behind
To the Coney Island line

Oh daddy-o, daddy-o
Oh daddy-o, daddy-o"
Rock,"It's the darkest hour, you're 22
The voice of youth, the hour of dread
It's the darkest hour, and your voice is new
Love is lost, and lost is love

Your country's new, your friends are new
Your house, and even your eyes are new
Your maid is new, and your accent, too
But your fear is as old as the world

Say goodbye to the thrills of life
When love was good, when love was bad
Wave goodbye to the life without pain
Say hello, your beautiful girl

Say hello to the greater men
Tell them your secrets they're like the grave
Oh what you have done, oh what you have done
Love is lost, lost is love

You know so much, it's making me cry
You refuse to talk, but you think like mad
You've cut out your zone and the things have fold
Oh what have you done, oh what have you done
Oh what have you done, oh what have you done"
Pop,"This is the time of year, that we learn to give
And the greatest gift is learning to forgive.
We will have the best that time we ever knew
If you forgive me and I forgive you

I don't want to light a fire
Unless it will warm your heart
I'm playin no holiday songs
I need you to sing your part
And baby if I could have just one wish come true
I don't wanna spend one more Christmas without you

It's so hard to believe
We're staring at the end
When all we think about is starting up again
Whatever we lost, when we were apart
We'll find it all alone in the dark

I don't wanna light a fire
Unless it will warm your heart
I'm playin no holiday songs
I need you to sing your part
And baby if I could have just one wish come true
I don't wanna spend one more Christmas without you

There's nothing more that I want from you
Then to lie here together
And stay here forever with you
There's no one I ever knew
That I wanted to spend Christmas with, more than you....

I don't want to light a fire
Unless it will warm your heart
I'm playin no holiday songs
I need you to sing your part
And baby if I could have just one wish come true
I don't wanna spend one more Christmas without you

I don't want to light a fire
Unless it will warm your heart
I'm playin no holiday songs
I need you to sing your part
And baby if I could have just one wish come true
I don't wanna spend one more Christmas
I don't wanna spend one more Christmas
I don't wanna spend one more Christmas without you

Rock,"New Jersey Turnpike,
riding on a wet night near the refinery's glow
Out where the great black rivers flow
License, registration: I ain't got none
But I got a clear conscience 'bout the things that I done

Mister state trooper, please don't stop me
Please don't stop me, please don't stop me
Maybe you got a kid, maybe you got a pretty wife
The only thing that I got's been bothering' me my whole life
Mister state trooper, please don't stop me
Please don't stop me, please don't stop me

In the wee, wee hours your mind get hazy
Radio relay towers lead me to my baby
The radio's jammed up with talk show stations
It's just talk, talk, talk, talk, till you lose your patience

Mister state trooper, please don't stop me

Hey, somebody out there, listen to my last prayer
Hiho silver-o, deliver me from nowhere."
Pop,"Hello there, by the corner
as I passed you by for the last time
tell me do I look familiar
cuz to me, I can see that I've seen you before

Hello there, do my shoes on the pavement
seem in place that they are
cuz I used to be falling apart
but now I'm back to the start

It took me so long to realize
It took me so long to see
So much more out there
A new harmony to my melody

And the song goes on in my head (x2)

Hello there, could you spare me a moment
As a matter of fact, throw your clock out the window
And give me all your time, make it mine

It took me so long to realize
It took me so long to see
So much more out there
A new harmony to my melody

And the song goes on in my head (x2)

It goes
Oh baby, baby baby baby, oh baby baby

Can't stop thinking about you
Can't get you out of my mind
You're song is playing in my head
Over and over again

It took me so long to realize
It took me so long to see
So much more out there
A new harmony to my melody

Woah, woah!

It took me so long to realize
It took me so long to see
So much more out there
A new harmony to my melody

And the song goes on in my head (x2)

It goes
Oh baby baby, baby baby baby, oh baby baby

And the song goes on in my head (8x)
Oh baby baby, baby baby baby (6x)
Oh oh, oh woah oh (x4)"
Rock,"A long, long time ago there lived an Indian boy,
When he came upon this Earth he brought his family joy.
A paranoid young brave was he, inside his frame was some misery,
He heard the other warriors talking angrily 'bout the white man taking over his country.


CHORUS
What he didn't know, is that some day his ma would be crying.
What he didn't know, is that some day his tribe would be dying.
What he didn't know, is that some day his father'd be gone.
What he didn't know, is that some day he'd be all alone.


None of the stories in the schoolbooks said it, the truth is gone and they're tryin' to forget it.
The history books are all one-sided, the truth is gone and their trying to hide it.
Who had the land 'till we came around? The Indian made his life from the ground.
And what about the boy that this story's about? Where his tee-pee once stood there now is a town.


CHORUS


He was the loneliest rider on the plain.
He was the loneliest rider on the plain.
He was the loneliest rider on the plain.

Rock,"Runnin' down the highway half-past eleven
Waitin' for my odometer to roll straight sevens
I'm a lucky man
I went to see the gypsy the other night
She looked in my palm, looked me in the eye
And said ""You're a lucky man""

""Some folks got fortune, some got eyes of blue
What you got will always see you through
You're a lucky man""
Pa went from the army to the factory to the killin' yard
I make my living with my hands 'hind the wheel of this car
I'm a lucky man

Messin' with me, man, it wouldn't be wise
Roll them dice, son . . snake eyes
I'm a lucky man

Had a girl in Calgary, I gave her up
Man, that love thing was messin' with my luck
And I'm a lucky man
I'll wake up tomorrow morning in another state
Kiss me now, baby, before it's too late
If you wanna kiss a lucky man
I don't miss no girl, I don't miss no home
He travels fastest who travels alone
He's a lucky man
A man with the world in the palm of his hands
"
Rock,"Meet a part of me that feels like every other day.
It has been seen in pictures and in alleyways.
Can see it through your walls.
Can see it through your fall.
Can see it on your floor, wrongway.
Lift your head up, Wednesday.
ItÂ?s almost 2:30.
When the walls start falling down you?ll be last to
be found.
That?s allright, malt liquor.
So you can promise me a day.
Not gonna promise nothing anyway.
Say you will,say you will and then you don?t."
Pop,"It's 3 in the morning and everybody already in bed
We're tired, we're yearning
But I got somebody else's I'm about to stay
Cause I've been trying to hold these urges back baby all day
We're hitting that body on body I still want you on my space
So we can do it your way way way way
I just want your body on me me me me
Cause you got me like ooh yeah, ooh yeah
I just wanna love you till you're on your way

So tonight

I'm gonna love you every second you're mine
We can go until the morning
I just wanna love you till your on the way, your way
I just wanna love you till you're on your way, your way
I just wanna love you till you're on your way, your way
Tonight
I'm gonna rock you like a baby
I just wanna love you till you're on your way, your way

I laid back and watch you
Hoping you got I wanna stay
But you're such a hustler
And I know you gotta get your pay
I just wanna love like this wasn't the last time
But time with you has been a dream
Tonight let's survive everything

So we can do it your way way way way
I just want your body on me me me me
Cause you got me like ooh yeah, ooh yeah

Tonight

I just wanna love you till you're on your way, your way

[Kyle]
I'm afraid that this is turned into something
Something I don't feel that often
I've been trying to fight back these urges
That isn't working
Your name is all in my searches
I think that we've waited long enough
I think that this love feels strong enough
I think I didn't wait your moment enough
I think that I wrote you songs enough
Did what you want enough, turned on enough
Why wouldn't you tell me this feels wrong or so girl
I wanted to us get passed the basics
I think I know where we can take it
'Cause I can show you a few me things and you things
I'm really in love with the way your hip and your mood swings
And it makes it all better when we're making up
And we can do it all again
While you're making up

So tonight
I'm gonna rock you like a baby tonight
I'm gonna love you every second you're mine
We can go until the morning
I just wanna love you till your on the way, your way
I just wanna love you till you're on your way, your way
I just wanna love you till you're on your way, your way
Tonight
I'm gonna rock your like a baby
I just wanna love you till you're on your way, your way"

Lean on, lean so me
Something tells me
That's the way it's gotta be
I can't really show you
What she future's gonna be
Just for now, little lady
Lean on me *To fall in love with love
Was maybe just a fantasy
And promises we made
Could be insane
Don't think of tomorrow
Yesterday is past
And if we could
You know we could make it last

Drink on, Drink on me
Slip and slide
So I'll forget reality
I can't really say
If I'll come on and get so free
But just for now, little lady
Drink on me

Just for now, little lady
Shine on me
Just for now, little lady

but you cancelled them for the third time

I'm stuck, thinking about you

Look what, you're putting me through, you're putting me through

Then I see your, car driving by in my street
Who's that girl in your passenger seat? yeah!

Tell me why can't you see, baby we're meant to be
Got your music up so loud, boy that you can't hear me

Now I'm walking down the street like it's a runway

That girl should be me

I read your letter, and I know what you meant.
That's you and me, in Salt Lake City.
You sure look pretty.

Wish we could go back again.

And are you on my mind, every day, all the time?
And though you're far away, don't you know, I feel the same.

Everything's gonna be okay.
Your friends aren't that far away.
Anyway.
Don't get so down on yourself.

Pop,"How does it feel when you're left sitting out in the cold?
How does it feel when you don't have nobody to hold?
I wanna know, does it really, really hurt you so?
Are you crying? Are you dying?

Do you want her like I wanted you before?
How does it feel to just stare at the ceiling all night?
How do you feel knowing someone is holding her tight?
Please tell me true, are you really really feeling blue?

Do you miss her, wanna kiss her?
Do you need her like I needed you before?
When you walked out on me, I felt like you're feeling now
But I'd take you back again 'cause I still love you, anyhow

I wanna know, does it really really hurt you so?
Are you crying? Are you dying?
Do you want her like I wanted you before?"
Rock,"He's the man who loves women
Women, women, women
He's the man who loves women
And fallin' in love every day

When he sees a senorita
It's a sure thing that
he'll heed her
He's the man who loves women
Fallin' in love every day

But in the mornin'
When she wakes up
He'll be far away
Keepin' his secret safe
Hey, hey, hey

He's quite prepared to mingle
Comes on like he's single
He's the man who loves women
And falling in love's just his way
One of these days he's gonna pay
For falling in love every day

Oh stay away"

I don't know, what to do.
In my heart I still love you.

Now hes running for the love of speed

No baby no baby no baby no
Hello humans can you feel me thinking
I asume you're seeing everything i'm thinking
Hello humans nothing starts tomorrow
I'm the baby now

Rock,"Well, Jimmy Lee was hookin' 'round the fan turn
of a funky Southern Florida dirt track.
He had mud caked on his goggles and a screamin' three fifty
stacked up on his back.
Well, as he passed the stands, he feeling all tuckered out,
when through the roar of his engine he heard somebody shout.
""Stand on it. Come on, boy, stand on it.""

Mary Beth started to shift, she hit the shift,
but she just couldn't get a hand on it.
She was racin' some red hill boys; she had the deed to the ranch
and a grand on it.
With eight grand blowin' hot on the red line,
she blew past a hitchhiker out on Route 39. He hollered,
""Stand on it. Come on, baby, stand on it.""

(Chorus)
Well, now when in doubt and you can't figure it out,
Just stand on it.
Well, if your mind's confused; you don't know what you're gonna do,
Well buddy, stand on it!
Well, if you've lost control of the situation at hand,
Go grab a girl; go see a rock 'n roll band,
and stand on it.
Come on, man, stand on it!

Well now, Columbus, he discovered America
even though he hadn't planned on it.
He got lost and woke up one morning
when he's about to land on it.
He wouldn't have got out of Italy, man, that's for sure,
without Queen Isabella standing on the shore shouting,
""Stand on it! Go ahead, man, stand on it.""

(repeat chorus)

Rock,"Like the clothes, like the tan, like the way you shake it.
Your the kind of a girl I can tell you make it.
Your the kind of a girl I can tell your goin' nowhere.
Your goin' nowhere.

Like the lips, like the look, like the way you show it.
Your the kind of girl that I like you know it.
Your the kind of a girl I would say your goin' nowhere.
Your goin' nowhere.

So take a ride with me now baby, hop inside and maybe baby.
We can find a way to make it all ok. Yeah.

Like the stance, like the sky, like the way you shake it.
Your the kind of a girl that looks better naked.
Your the kind of a girl I would say is goin' nowhere.
Your goin' nowhere.

Yeah-A-Oh-A-Whow-Ho-Yeah
Yeah-A-Oh-A-Way-Hey-Ho
Way-Hey-Oh-A-Way-Hey-Ho- Your goin' nowhere.

Take a ride with me now baby, hop inside and maybe baby.
We can find a way to make it all ok. Yeah.

Like the clothes, like the tan, like the way you shake it.
Your the kind of a girl I can tell you make it.
Your the kind of a girl I would say is goin' nowhere.

Pop,"Somebody said you got a new friend
Does she love you better than I can
There's a big black sky over my town
I know where you at, I bet she's around

Yeah I know it's stupid
But I just got to see it for myself

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her
I'm right over here, why can't you see me
I'm givin' it my all, but I'm not the girl you're
takin' home
I keep dancin' on my own

I'm just gonna dance all night
I'm all messed up, I'm so out of line
Stilettos and broken bottles
I'm spinning around in circles

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her
I'm right over here, why can't you see me
I'm givin' it my all, but I'm not the girl you're takin' home
I keep dancin' on my own

So far away, but still so near
The lights go on, the music dies
But you don't see me, standing here
I just came to say goodbye

I'm in the corner watching you kiss her
I'm givin' it my all, but I'm not the girl you're
takin' home
I keep dancin' on my own

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her
I'm right over here, why can't you see me
I'm givin' it my all, but I'm not the girl you're
takin' home
I keep dancin' on my own"
Rock,"written by Warren Zevon and J. D. Souther Zevon Music Inc. BMI

I woke up this morning and fell out of bed
Trouble waiting to happen
Should've quit while I was ahead
Trouble waiting to happen
I turned on the news to the Third World War
Opened up the paper to World War IV
Just when I thought it was safe to be bored
Trouble waiting to happen
Trouble waiting to happen

The mailman brought me the Rolling Stone
Trouble waiting to happen
It said I was living at home alone
Trouble waiting to happen
I read things I didn't know I'd done
It sounded like alot of fun
I guess I've been bad or something
Trouble waiting to happen
Trouble waiting to happen

Trouble waiting to happen
Teardrops ready to start
Trouble waiting to happen to my heart

This just ain't gonna be my day
Trouble waiting to happen
Things just ain't gonna go my way
Trouble waiting to happen
My day was over by a quarter to ten
I climbed right back into bed again
I'd write this down if I could hold a pen
I might get better but I don't know when
So I'm gonna wait right here 'til then
Trouble waiting to happen
Trouble waiting to happen

Trouble waiting to happen
Teardrops ready to fall
Trouble waiting to happen to us all

Rock,"You know I see you when you're sleeping
When you're all insane with dreaming.
I can tell you that you been fighting, baby,
But you been losing.

You know there's clearer ways of thinking
And there's quicker ways of dying
But I'm a sucker for your drinking
And now, I'm losing.

I don't know who you think you're cheating
Or with whom you have been sleeping,
But all the shit that you've been eating
Says you're losing.

When I let my hate pervert me
And there's no more tears for crying
I'll just kill you if you hurt me,
I'll kill you.

You know I see you when you're sleeping,
When you're all insane with dreaming.
I can tell you that you been fighting, baby,
Fighting hard and losing.

Fighting hard ... and losing.
"
Pop,"If love is what you want
Baby here I am
If tenderness is what you need
I've got that to give
If you need some affection
Baby these are open arms
Open arms, open arms, open arms, open arms

You come hem you've had a hard day
Every door you tried to open
Was closing in your face
I'm right here I'll be right here
I'll embrace you

I'll be open with my heart
I'll let you in
I'll be open with my thoughts
I'll be your best friend
If you need some attention
Baby these are open arms
Open arms, open arms, open arms, open arms

Every corner you turn
Trouble come your way
But when you get home
I'll try to be there
And I'll embrace you

These...These are
These...These are
These...These are
Open arms

If time is what you need
Baby I'll stop the clocks
If you're looking for something
Maybe I've got what you want
If there's one thing to remember
Don't forget that these are open arms
Open arms, open arms, open arms, open arms

These...These are
These...These are
These...These are
Open arms"
Rock,"No stars in the sky
The night seems so dark around you
You won't say a word
And wonder why no one's found you
Waiting for love
Praying for love again

Love's a heavy weight
Give it to me, don't hesitate
Love's a heavy thing
Heavy for one heart to bring me your love
Give me your love again
It's not your fault
One heart can never win
It takes
Two hearts
Two hearts just to hold love
Two hearts
Two hearts just to hold your lo-o-o-o-o-ve
Your lo-o-o-o-o-ve

And if your heart should ache
Remember me
And if your heart should break

Two hearts
Two hearts they can mend it
Heartache
Heartaches can be ended by love
By love
Love's a heavy weight
Give to me don't hesitate
Love's a heavy thing
And heavy for one heart to bring me your love
Give me your love again
It's not too late
One heart can never win
It takes two hearts
Two hearts just to hold love
Two hearts
Two hearts just to hold your lo-o-o-o-o-ve
Your lo-o-o-o-o-ve

"
Rock,"I let the beast in too soon, I don't know how to live
Without my hand on his throat; I fight him always & still
O darling, it's so sweet, you think you know how crazy
-How crazy I am
You say you don't spook easy, you won't go, but I know
And I pray that you will
-Fast as you can, baby run-free yourself of me
Fast as you can
I may be soft in your palm but I'll soon grow
Hungry for a fight, and I will not let you win
My pretty mouth will frame the phrases that will
Disprove your faith in man
So if you catch me trying to find my way into your
Heart from under your skin
-Fast as you can, baby scratch me out, free yourself
Fast as you can
Fast as you can, baby scratch me out, free yourself
Fast as you can
Sometimes my mind don't shake and shift
But most of the time, it does
And I get to the place where I'm begging for a lift
Or I'll drown in the wonders and the was
And I'll be your girl, if you say it's a gift
And you give me some more of your drugs
Yeah, I'll be your pet, if you just tell me it's a gift
Cuz I'm tired of whys, choking on whys,
Just need a little because, because
I let the beast in and then;
I even tried forgiving him, but it's too soon
So I'll fight again, again, again, again, again.
And for a little while more, I'll soar the
Uneven wind, complain and blame
The sterile land
But if you're getting any bright ideas, quiet dear
I'm blooming within
Fast as you can, baby wait watch me, I'll be out
Fast as I can, maybe late but at least about
Fast as you can leave me, let this thing
Run its route
Fast as you can (repeat 4 times)

And bring me down to her lightning shack
You can watch my partner reeling
She moves up! She moves back!
Out on the floor there ain't nobody cleaner
She does this thing she calls the ""Jump back Jack""
She's got the heart of a ballerina

Straight from the Bronx, hung on the line.
She slips she slides she slops she bops, she bumps, she grinds
Even them dance hall hacks from the west side of the tracks
Move in close to catch her timing
She moves up! She moves back!
Out on the floor there ain't nobody cleaner
She does this thing she calls the ""Jump back Jack""
She's got the heart of a ballerina

She ain't no little girl, she ain't got no curls
And in her brown little eyes an image
Round and round and round and round and round...
She whirls

My heart's wood, she's a carpenter
She's an angel in the night what she does is all right.
Dance with me partner
Dance with me partner
Dance with me partner
Dance with me partner
'Til the dawn!
Oh 'til the dawn

Thundercrack!
Baby's back
This time she'll tell me how she really feels
And bring me down to her lightning shack
You can watch my partner reeling
She moves up! She moves back!
Out on the floor there ain't nobody cleaner
She does this thing she calls the ""Jump back Jack""
She's got the heart of a ballerina

She has parents! She has religion! She has sisters!
Round and round and round and round and round...
She whirls
My heart's wood, she's a carpenter
She's an angel in the night what she does is all right.
Dance with me partner
Dance with me partner
Dance with me partner

Rock,"I'm looking good got my shoulders back
few more drinks I'm off to dance
I get the eye as I lift my glass the first time in six months
she looks again I start to shake
my shoulders twitching I'm on my way
glance behind me for safety's sake
to see a clock the size of a plane

the night is young more fish in the sea
who's to say she wasn't looking at me
sink my head back into my glass
get into shape for that first dance
I turn away look to the south
pull my foot from out of my mouth
to my surprise she's standing beside me
asking if I'd like to dance

I'm standing in a hall of smoke
her tongue's in my mouth I'd like to choke
her knight approaches us on foot
left his sidekick drink at the brook
he offers me a cigarette I said i'm too young to smoke
so he tried to entertain me told me one more crappy...
joke in my ear except the joke wasn't clear
set the joking aside should I run should I hide
I've decided to stay rub it straight in his face
what he thought was the case was an easy mistake

I just like to try some carrot cake and wine
can't I try taste some carrot cake and wine

looking good not looking back
knight of hers took her off to dance
I get the eye as I lift my glass but not for the last time
she looks again I start to shake
my eyes are twitching my legs are fake
glance behind me for safety's sake
to see my girlfriend's tongue in the face
of a friend who is far from a man
should I hide should I run
must have seen what I've done
I decided to stay like the look on her face
what I thought was the case was an easy mistake

I just like to try some carrot cake and wine
can't I try taste some carrot cake and wine
and why should I lie
why can't I try
taste some
buy my
try some
carrot cake and wine

Pop,"So no one told you life was gonna be this way
Your job's a joke, you're broke
Your love life's D. O. A
It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week
Your month, or even your year, but

I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to pour
I'll be there for you
Like I've been there before
I'll be there for you
'Cause you're there for me too

You're still in bed at ten and work began at eight
You've burned your breakfast, so far things are going great
Your mother warned you there'd be days like these
But she didn't tell you when the world has brought
You down to your knees that

I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to pour
I'll be there for you
Like I've been there before
I'll be there for you
'Cause you're there for me too

No one could ever know me
No one could ever see me
Seems you're the only one who knows
What it's like to be me
Someone to face the day with
Make it through all the rest with
Someone I'll always laugh with
Even at my worst, I'm best with you

It's like you're always stuck in second gear
And when it hasn't been your day, your week
Your month, or even your year

I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to pour
I'll be there for you
Like I've been there before
I'll be there for you
'Cause you're there for me too"
Rock,"Here she comes, you better watch your step
She's going to break your heart in two, it's true
It's not hard to realize
Just look into her false colored eyes
She builds you up to just put you down, what a clown

'Cause everybody knows
(She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please
(She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease
(She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks

You're put down in her book
You're number 37, have a look
She's going to smile to make you frown, what a clown
Little boy, she's from the street
Before you start, you're already beat
She's gonna play you for a fool, yes it's true

'Cause everybody knows
(She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please
(She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease
(She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks"
Rock,"I guess I just must be a daredevil
I don't feel anything until I smash it up
I'm caught on the cold, caught on the hot
Not so with the warmer lot
And all I want is a confidant
To help me laugh it off

And don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone

Say I'm an airplane
And the gashes I got from my heartbreak
Make the slots and the flaps upon my wing
And I use them to give me lip
Hip hip for the lift
Hip hip for the drag
I want them all in my bag
Oh give me anything and I'll turn it into a gift

But don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone

Seek me out
Look at, look at, look at, look at me
I'm all the fishes in the sea
Wake me up
Give me, give me, give me what you got
In your mind, in the middle of the night

Maybe you let me look out for you
Protect what I found in you
And never let it starve
Then that way, you let me stay
Skirt in my skirt like I want to
And I will try hard to hold onto you with open arms

But don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone"
Rock,"I heard Woodrow Wilson's guns
I heard Maria crying
Late last night I heard the news
That Veracruz was dying
Veracruz was dying

Someone called Maria's name
I swear it was my father's voice
Saying, ""If you stay you'll all be slain
You must leave now - you have no choice
Take the servants and ride west
Keep the child close to your chest
When the American troops withdraw
Let Zapata take the rest""

I heard Woodrow Wilson's guns
I heard Maria calling
Saying, ""Veracruz is dying
And Cuernavaca's falling""

Aquel dia yo jure (On that day I swore
Hacia el puerto volvere To the port I will return
Aunque el destino cambio mi vida Even though destiny changed my life
En Veracruz morire In Veracruz I shall die
Aquel dia yo jure On that day I swore)

I heard Woodrow Wilson's guns
I heard them in the harbor
Saying, ""Veracruz is dying"""
Rock,"Now we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that we've been done wrong
Lies jumped the queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design

He thinks he's well screened from the man at the top
It's a shame that his children disagree
They cooly decide to sell him down the line
Daddy's brainwashing time

He's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me
He's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me

She's quite enthralled with the childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure not a she
When lovers chose each other now the perk's are due
Another memo to screw

She's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me
She's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me

Can you wipe your nose my child without them stlotting in your file a photograph
Can you sleep alone at night wake to find the scorching light of neighbour Jim
He's come to turn you in

Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another do, do
"
Pop,"No one can tell me
That you were right for me girl
You could have told me
To run a lap around the world
All that time I was hypnotized
While you uh behind my back
Now my mind keeps me up all night
Why'd you have to say bye like that?

I should have cheated on you
I was everything you wanted and more
I should have cheated on you
Nobody told me I was dating a whore

I should have cheated, cheated, cheated
I should have cheated, cheated, cheated
I should have cheated, cheated, cheated
I should have cheated, cheated, cheated

My friends should have told me
You weren't the one for me girl
You weren't the one for me girl
Cause you almost sold me
I bought a rock for you girl
I bought a rock
All that time I was hypnotized
While you uh behind my back
Now my mind keeps me up all night
Why'd you have to say bye like that?

I should have cheated on you
I was everything you wanted and more
I should have cheated on you
Nobody told me I was dating a whore

I should have cheated, cheated, cheated
I should have cheated, cheated, cheated
I should have cheated, cheated, cheated
I should have cheated, cheated, cheated

Liar, liar, hey girl
You gon' tell all your friends
That I'm talking about you
I'm talking about you
You gon' tell, you gon' tell
All you friends
That I'm talking about you
I'm talking about you
I'm talking about you

This song is for you

I should have cheated on you
I was everything you wanted and more
I should have cheated on you

Pop,"Amy
Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make up a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

Dani
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Katherine
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

Dani, Lisa and Lauren
I can see your halo halo halo
Do your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo

Lisa
Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again
Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
The risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out

Lauren
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more

Do your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
Do your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
Halo, halo

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can see your halo halo halo
Do your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
Do your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
Do your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo"
Rock,"I kiss your lips and take your hands
When I look in your eyes
I can see the feeling of what I found
I focus on the special times on my mind

You and me that night
when the rain was falling
Falling over our heads
Look into my eyes and tell me my friend
I hope so, but I do not want to see you cry

I thought about that night because I love you
I love you
I love your smile
I love your way

I love how you look at me and kiss me
I just love you"
Pop,"I was 16 with a rocket
And some sunshine in my pocket
It was how you used words I didn't know
And the way you said my name
And cut up peaches and them brown eyes
Little flame that we pretend doesn't glow

[Pre-Chorus]
You know space and time wouldn't let you be mine
What I've come to understand
Is entropy wouldn't leave you to me
I'm right back where I began

[Chorus]
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remember your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm knocked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love

[Verse 2]
There were times I think about us
Overcome by the nostalgias
I am on call when you need me, let me know
But we're drifting in a strange way
I'm aware that it's mistake if I love you
It's a mistake if I don't

[Pre-Chorus]
You know space and time wouldn't let you be mine
What I've come to understand
Is entropy wouldn't leave you to me
I'm right back where I began

[Chorus]
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remember your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm knocked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love

[Bridge]
And she smelled like Michigan
And it felt like lust
And the nostalgia's killing me
And it's all because

[Chorus]
I'm in the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remember your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm knocked up
In the arms of a stranger, stranger, stranger
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remember your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm knocked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love"
Rock,"It's your time
It's your day
It's never too late
To change lanes
How's your life?
How's your place?
Was it where you wanted
Your head to lay?

But wait, you can breathe
You can see what I can see
Don't waste your time
You can't make back

If you could rewind your time
Would you change your life?

Do you like you?
Do you love your wife?
Or did you pick what
You're told was right?

Dream and be
What you feel
Don't you compromise
What you wanna be

'Cause change is okay
What's the point in staying the same
Regrets, forget what's dead and gone

If you could rewind your time
Would you change your life?

If Jesus rode in on a camel today
With your cross on his shoulder
Time to take you away
Have you done all you wanted?
Are you happy and warm?
Do you miss someone special
You don't see anymore?
Have you blood on your hands?
Do you dream of white sands?
Can you sleep well at night?
Fave you done all you can?
The place I was born in
Stays crooked and straight
I see innocent blue eyes
Go blind everyday

Rewind your time
Would you change your life
Today?"
Pop,"I've tried everything, to get you off my mind. I've been running round, breaking things, getting into fights (woah oh oh)
(i've tried everything)
To get you off my mind.

We used to climb Primrose Hill,
when it was just the two of us
We used to run up the stairs,
on the double decker bus and ohhh..
I can't do that anymore, no
It just reminds me of before.

I've tried everything, to get you off my mind. I've been running round, breaking things,
getting into fights
I don't know what it takes,

Ooh, i wish we didn't have the thing with us
I've tried everything, everything, tonight now.
I see you girl, across the street,
On a sunny afternoon
And if i look, through half-closed eyes,
She looks a bit like you, and ohhh..
It just reminds me of before,
No I can't do this anymore.

I've tried everything, to get you off my mind. I've been running round,
Breaking things, getting into fights
I don't know what it takes, ooh, i wish we didn't have the thing with us I've tried everything, everything, tonight now.
All the days I missed her,
Can't break down, can't break up
Sleepless nights that come around
I wish I could pretend, ohhh.
I can't do this anymore.

I've tried everything, to get you off my mind. I've been running round, breaking things, getting into fights I don't know what it takes, ooh, i wish we didn't have the thing with us
I've tried everything, everything,
Tonight now. Woah oh oh
(Everything, everything baby,
to get you off my mind))
I've tried everything, everything, tonight now."
Rock,"She is a Queen
A mistress of the Darkness
She is my Quenn
The mistress of my heart

When I look to her face
I lost myself into your eyes
She is a beautifull woman
Hot as the fire

She is a Vampyre
The poison into my veins
Your lips are red
red like blood
and your hair is black
black as the night


She is a Queen
A Mistress of the Darkness
She is my Queen
The Mistress of my heart
She is a Vampyre
The poison into my veins
She is a beautifull woman
Hot as the fire"
Rock,"(Ronnie Lane)

I close my eyes and ignore all the signs
I'm walking 'round in circles
I've closed my ears and believed my own lies
And break the silence always

I make a lot of words, big storm in the air
All 'round your hair it's blowing
Just leave it be and it will all blow away
The weather's always changing

You can go if you want to
I don't own you, go be wild
Leave my hand, it's wide open
So's the door evermore

It hurts me more to think I'll keep you in chains
Than if you were to leave me.
I am what you are and I'm running too,
All for the open prairie.

So you can go if you want to
I don't own you, go be wild
Leave my hand it's wide open
So's the door forevermore.
"
Rock,"ANNA I

So we saved up, bought ourselves an outfit,
Nighties, nylons, beautiful dresses.
Soon we found a job that was going,
A job as dancer in a cabaret,
A job in memphis, the second big town we came to.

Oh how hard it was for Anna!
Beautiful clothes can make a good girl particular â€”
When the drinking tigress meets herself in the pool,
She's apt to become a menace.

She began talking about art (of all things),
About the Art (if you please) of Cabaret.
In Memphis, the second big town we came to,
It wasn't Art that sort of people came for.
That sort of people came for something else;

And when a man has paid for his evening
He expects a good show in return.
So if you cover up your bosom and thighs like you had a rash,
Don't be surprised to see them yawning.

So I told my art-loving sister Anna:
""Leave your pride to those who can well afford it.
Do what you are asked to do and not what you want,
For that isn't what is wanted.""

Oh but I had trouble, I can tell you,
With her fancy pig-head notions.
Night by night I sat by her bedside,
Holding her hand and saying this:
""Think of our little house in Louisiana!""

FAMILY

O Lord, look down upon our daughter,
Show her the way that leads the good to Thy reward.
Who fights the good fight and all self subdues,
"
Rock,"I got a story it's almost finished
all I need is someone to tell it too
maybe, that's you.

our time is borrowed and spent to freely
every minute I have needs to be made up
but how?
I'm looking for a nice way to say
""I'm out.""
I want out.

I fall asleep with my friends around me
only place Iknow, I feel safe
Im gonna call this home

the open road is still miles away
ain't nothing serious
we still have our fun
oh we had it once

but windows open and close
that's just how it goes

don't it feel like sunshine after all
the world we love forever, gone
we're only just as happy
as everyone else seems to think we are

Im in love with the ordinary
Ineed a simple space
to rest my head
and everything gets clear
well I'm a little ashamed for asking
but just a little helps
it gets me straight again
helps me get over it

it might seem like a dream
but it's real to me

don't it feel like sunshine after all
the world we love forever, gone
we're only just as happy
as everyone else seems to think we are

you should see the canals are freezing
you should see me high
you should just be here
be with me here
it doesn't seem theres hope for me
I let you down
but I won't give in now
not for any amount"

If you told me that you loved me
I would feel so proud
You let me hold you honey
I would holler out loud
I'll never love another
Even if I can
Oh, come to me, baby
I'm a one woman man

Won't you let me, baby,
Just a kinda' hang around
I'll always love you honey
And I'll never let you down
I'll never love another
Even if I can
Oh, come to me, baby
I'm a one woman man

I'd climb the highest mountain
If it reached up to the sky
To prove that I loved you
I would jump off and fly
I'd even swim the ocean
From shore to shore
To prove that I love you
Just a little bit more

Won't you let me, baby,
Just a kinda' hang around
I'll always love you honey

Don't take your love away from me
Don't you leave my heart in misery
If you go then I'll be blue

Remember when you held me tight
And you kissed me all through the night
Think of all that we've been through
And breaking up is hard to do

They say that breaking up is hard to do
Now I know I know that it's true
Don't say that this is the end
Instead of breaking up I wish that we were making up again

Pop,"I was wonderin' 'bout your mama
Did she get that job she wanted?
Sell that car that gave her problems?
I'm just curious 'bout her, honest

Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good

I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends?
Can we still be friends?
Doesn't have to end
And if it ends, can we be friends?

Can we be friends?

Wonderin' if you got a body
To hold you tighter since I left
Wonderin' if you think about me
Actually, don't answer that

Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good

I'm wonderin'

Pop,"Took a walk around the block
Didn't stop, all this space
It makes me want to see your face
Such a beautiful place
When I met you last I was at a loss
Life goes on
Breakin' hard into the ground
It was you that I found

I can run if you are callin'
I can fly if you are fallin'
I can break through every wall they build for me
I can see the sun is risin'
I can see your eyes are smilin'
I will hold onto the things that I believe
Believe

Shut my eyes I feel alive
Hold me back
In our hearts, we'll wear the scars
Of the wilderness years
Give me one more night at last
Filled with joy
When your guard is down
And you're hand in hand
Will you understand how lucky we are
It's been a very long day

I can run if you are callin'
I can fly if you are fallin'
I can break through every wall they build for me

Close your eyes and you will see

Tell me we got time

Won't be anybody after you

Then I woke up
You said it was over

Climbing up Mount Everest
I swear it's like
Crawling from here to Memphis
Knocked senseless, like
Digging a hole to China to find
You don't love me anymore

Night after night
I come home
Watch it on the news who else was overthrown
I don't understand it
As hard as I try
But I keep crossing over the great divide
And it's like

Climbing up Mount Everest
I swear it's like
Crawling from here to Memphis
Knocked senseless, like
Digging a hole to China to find
You don't love me anymore

Shine the light
Ring the bell

I'll survive

Rock,"Every single night
I endure the flight
Of little wings of white-flamed
Butterflies in my brain
These ideas of mine
Percolate the mind
Trickle down the spine
Swarm the belly, swelling to a blaze
That's when the pain comes in
Like a second skeleton
Trying to fit beneath the skin
I can't fit the feelings in, no
Every single night's alright with my brain

What'd I say to her
What'd I say to her
What does she think of me
That I'm not what I ought to be
That I'm what I try not to be
It's got to be somebody else's fault
I can't get caught
If what I am is what I am, cause I does what I does
Then brother, get back, cause my breast's gonna bust open
The rib is the shell and the heart is the yolk and
I just made a meal for us both to choke on
Every single night's a fight with my brain

I just want to feel everything
I just want to feel everything
I just want to feel everything

So I'm gonna try to be still now
Gonna renounce the mill a little while and
If we had a double-king-sized bed
We could move in it and I'd soon forget
That what I am is what I am, cause I does what I does
And maybe I'd relax, let my breast shot bust open
My heart's made of parts of all that surround me
And that's why the devil just can't get around me
Every single night's alright, every single night's a fight
And every single fight's alright with my brain

I just want to feel everything
I just want to feel everything
I just want to feel everything
I just want to feel everything"
Rock,"There's a cross up yonder up on Calvary Hill
There's a slip of blood on a silver knife
There's a graveyard kid down below
Where at night did come to life
And above the stars, they crackle in fire
A dead man's moon throws seven rings
Well, we put our ears to the cold grave stones
This is the song they'd sing
We are alive
And though our bodies lie alone here in the dark
Our spirits rise to carry the fire and light the spark
To stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart

A voice cried out, I was killed in Maryland in 1877
When the railroad workers made their stand
Well, I was killed in 1963 one Sunday morning in Birmingham
Well, I died last year crossing the southern desert
My children left behind in San Pablo
Well they left our bodies here to rot
Oh please let them know
We are alive
Oh, and though we lie alone here in the dark
Our souls will rise to carry the fire and light the spark
To fight shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart

Let your mind rest easy, sleep well my friend
It's only our bodies that betray us in the end

I awoke last night in a dark and dreamy deep
From my head to my feet, my body had gone stone cold
There were worms crawling all around me
Fingers scratching at an earth black and six foot low

And alone in the blackness of my grave
Alone I'd been left to die
Then I heard voices calling all around me
The earth rose above me, my eyes filled with sky
We are alive
And though our bodies lie alone here in the dark
Our souls and spirits rise

To carry the fire and light the spark
To fight shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart
To stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart
We are alive"
Rock,"Another wave crash over you
It put you in a spell
On a cold place you know well

It pulls you further out to sea
Under the lights at Tilbury
Life still love
Your melody

In a tide end town
Everyone hallucinating on you
But a northern whale
Wouldn't leave until all England's tears are done

They only see you in a dream
Lying by a dark machine
Sing on love
Your melody"
Rock,"War made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mear
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier

Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade
Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier

Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless, lonely days

Then one day, in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longingly
At the ice-cream in the hand of
The little bombardier

Sunshine entered our Frankie's days
Gone his worries, his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy

Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He brought them presents with every coin he made

Then two gentlemen called on him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game?

Leave them alone or we'll get sore
We've had blokes like you in the station before
The hand of authority said ""no more""
To the little bombardier

Packed his bags, his heart in pain
Wiped a tear and caught a train
Not to be seen in the town again

More stars than what I'm seeing
More hurtful what I find behind that door
More power, more passion
Instead of just acting
Like I'm the one that he's been looking for

I oughta say I'm sorry

Stop crying on his shoulder
He'd probably say it's alright
And hold me while my tears pour

More fire, more feeling
More stars than what I'm seeing
More hurtful what I find behind that door
More power, more passion
Instead of this acting
Like I'm the one that he's been looking for

Lying in the green grass
Underneath the blue sky
Looking at a good man
And I know he's the right guy
He's got that kinda heart that
Any girl would die for

So, how could I want more?
How could I want more?"
Rock,"Long Walk Home

Last night I stood at your doorstep
Trying to figure out what went wrong
You just slipped something into my palm and you were gone

I could smell the same deep green of summer
'Bove me the same night sky was glowin'
In the distance I could see the town where I was born

It's gonna be a long walk home
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
A long walk home

In town I pass Sal's grocery
Barber shop on South Street
I looked in their faces*
They're all rank strangers to me*
Well Veteran's Hall high upon the hill
Stood silent and alone
The diner was shuttered and boarded
With a sign that just said ""gone""

It's gonna be a long walk home
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
It's gonna be a long walk home

[Sax break]

Here everybody has a neighbor
Everybody has a friend
Everybody has a reason to begin again

My father said ""Son, we're lucky in this town,
It's a beautiful place to be born.
It just wraps its arms around you,
Nobody crowds you and nobody goes it alone""

""Your flag flyin' over the courthouse
Means certain things are set in stone.
Who we are, what we'll do and what we won't""

It's gonna be a long walk home
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
It's gonna be a long walk home
It's gonna be a long walk home
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me

Rock,"One grows weary of everything, my angel. It is the law of nature, it is not my fault.

If for example I had as much love as you have virtue, and that is surely saying a lot, is it not astonishing that we should end at the same time as the other ? It is not my fault.

From this, it follows that for some time I have been deceiving you. But then, your pitiless affection forced me as it were to do so. It is not my fault.

Today, a woman I love madly insists that I sacrifice you to her. It is not my fault.

I realise that this is a fine opportunity for crying out on perjury, but if nature's only given men assurance, or if she gave women obstinacy, it is not my fault.

Take my advice: choose another lover, as I have chosen another mistress. This is good advice. Very good. If you think it bad, it is not my fault.

Farewell, my angel, I took you with pleasure, I abandon you without regret. Perhaps I will come back, to you. So goes the world, it is not my fault.

Pop,"Hmm
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Oh, ho the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by golly have a holly, jolly Christmas
This year

Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me

Pop,"Lookin back on when I
Was a little nappy-headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy

Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring

Sneaking out the back door
To hangout with those hoodlum friends of mine, ooh yeah
Greeted at the back door
Boy, thought I told you not to go outside.

Trying the best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whoopin' your behind.

I wish these days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
Cause I loved them so

Brother says he's tellin
About you playin doctor with that girl
Just don't tell, I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world

Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through

Smoking cigarettes and
Writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the
Principal's office down the hall

You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right
But while you were doin it, it sure felt outta sight

I wish these days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go"

Rise up shepherd, rise up
Your flock has roamed far from the hill
The stars have faded, the sky is still
The angels are shouting ""Glory Hallelujah""

We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground
We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground

Forty days and nights of rain have washed this land
Jesus said the money changers in this temple will not stand
Find your flock, get them to higher ground
Flood waters rising and we're Canaan bound

We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground

Tend to your flock or they will stray
We'll be called for our service come Judgment Day
Before we cross that river wide
Blood on our hands will come back on us twice

Rise up shepherd, rise up
Your flock has roamed far from the hill
Stars have faded, the sky is still
Sun's in the heavens and a new day's rising

You use your muscle and your mind and you pray your best
That your best is good enough, the Lord will do the rest
You raise your children
And you teach 'them to walk straight and sure
You pray that hard times, hard times, come no more
You try to sleep, you toss and turn, the bottom's dropping out
Where you once had faith now there's only doubt
You pray for guidance, only silence now meets your prayers
The morning breaks, you awake but no one's there

We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground
There's a new day coming
We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground

We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground
A new day's coming
We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground

Friend only to the undertaker

To thousands of mothers' eyes
When their sons go out to fight
And their daughters lose their lives in

The news of war, it breaks my heart and closes my mind
War has laid waste to a whole generation
Induction then destruction
And who wants to die in a

Said it's so good, said it's unreal
Might not last, but it's no big deal

Save me with your sweet smile
Honey I really need you
To help me kill a little bit of time

They go wild when the lights go down
They gotta little money, live in a dream
Wanna be the queen of their little scene

I want to make this moment last
Slow down the pace, there's no hurry

Let me be the one to say when I've had enough


Just let me close my eyes, memorize
The way things are this minute
So when you're gone I can go on
If memory can hold within it what I'm feeling
Should time try fading or stealing something away

Hold on, nothing's the same
Tell me why I feel this way
Life wouldn't be worth living without you
All along I've been the pretender
But now that's gone forever
Nobody's ever loved me like you do
Nobody's broken through


Got to concentrate, file away
Every last detail
Don't want to lost what's going down
I want to remember everything I'm feeling
Should time try fading or stealing something away

I see a pretty girl and I wanna make her mine
They send my rocket to the sky I want them

One thing they got in common

Getting me in so much trouble but that's alright with me

Silence the siren between us

Now I drink back the past
Back to our wedding day
We'd hang onto every
Word the other would say

Blanket on Bluebell Knoll
Under a starry night holding us close
As Jupiter winked at the Earth
On that our wedding day

I run back to your arms again
Back there, safe in your arms again

Your thoughts safely were shared
My secrets to you I gave
I swore angels were born
You said heaven can be made

Above us on Bluebell Knoll
The laughing seven maids chased by the bull
As Virgo she danced through the dawn
On that our wedding day

I run back to your arms again
Back there, safe in your arms again

The deafening sound of silence
Silence the siren between us

I run back to your arms again
Back, there safe in your arms again
I run back to your arms again

Now I take off the mask
That hides all this from your gaze
As you sleep I pretend you dream
Of our wedding day"

I loved her but now I've lost her, loves in vain.
I watch a funeral in the rain.

I'm talking, I keep on talking about a girl.
I loved her but now I've lost her, loves in vain.

Everyone from the place
Come on with the rain

And the sun forgets to rise

But it's better I stay dry

Stare into the glass
And wait for the time to pass
And thank you for the offer
But you know I must decline
Never more than two drinks away from crying

There used to be a time
when I could hold my head up high
My life stretched out before me
Rivers flow with wine
I had my love beside me
And everything was fine

Now the ride is over
It's hard to say goodbye

This whole promise fades
And midnight turns to day

I'd love to drown my sorrow
But I cannot tell a lie
No more than two drinks away from crying"

Remember when we were angels
Before we stole cars
And when sex and drugs
Lived up in another world... not a care in the world

Hide and seek, kissing and running
Til you were out of breath
In the late day sun
Until your mamma called you home... and you didn't wanna go


Fly High
Be my getaway
Gotta get away
Fly High
Be my getaway
Gotta get away

Coppers, robbers, cowboys and indians
Hanging round the corner
Of the street you lived
How come it seemed so far away... just a stone throw away

Your best friend wasn't someone you worked with
And money from your old man
Would burn a hole
In your pocket all day... not a single debt to pay

Fly High
Be my getaway
Gotta get away

Be my getaway
Gotta get away

Fly High
Be my getaway
Gotta get away

Like you were my life
I did you so much
I feel like your mama
My friends are my family then I'll be fine
So I met a guy
His name was white
He loved me and I put him back for his sake
Cuz he was so good at being so bad
He drove me crazy like being a cab
He went outta town
Told me that I, was the only girl that he want in his life
And I was naive and yes I believe
All the B. S that he was telling to me
Taken without but I was wrong
He didn't know what he had till I was gone
I hope she was worth it, he had me cursing
When I see cupid I tell him in person
(haha) like this

Love is so S. T. U. P. I. D Oh
love is so S. T. U. P. I. D oh
love is so stupid
Cupid What's the matter with your aim at my heart
Just a game to you
Love is so Stupid
Keep on missing every shot you take of my heart
And break it in two
Love is so Stupid

I'm so afraid now to fall for him
This new one is a good guy, (yeah)
I already feel like we're best friends
Why am I not closing my eyes, cuz I feel messed up
From the aftermath
Of what the wrong one did to me, I wish I felt better
All the fear I have I know he's so right for me
Love is so (damn)

Love is so S. T. U. P. I. D Oh
love is so S. T. U. P. I. D Oh
love is so stupid
Cupid What's the matter with your aim at my heart
Just a game to you
Love is so Stupid
Keep on missing every shot you take of my heart
And break it in two
Love is so Stupid

Just the thought about being alone
Another valentine ain't nobody calling my phone, well
I'd rather be with my family and friends
Then let my poor heart get shattered again

Love is so S. T. U. P. I. D Oh
love is so S. T. U. P. I. D Oh
love is so stupid
Cupid What's the matter with your aim at my heart
Just a game to you
Love is so Stupid
Keep on missing every shot you take of my heart

How does one explain to him what it is you do
He says daddy daddy please tell me its not true
What all the people are saying....saying about you

There comes a time when one must face the life that you have led
That is a hard thing to do when lies is all that has been said
And the blameless eyes of an innocent youth
Is begging for you to tell the truth
It's such a hard way to learn.....hard way to learn

This moment of truth will hurt for life
Don't need to tell you that ain't right
Come now little boy don't you cry
'Cause the child in you is still alive

Conversation with the child who once believed in you
How does one explain to him what it is you do
He says daddy daddy please tell me it's not true
What all the people are saying....saying about you

There comes a time in this child's life when the boy becomes a man
So many things from his past he now can understand
Like all the times when dad would leave and be gone for so long
And he thought everything was all right
And he thought everything was all right

This moment of truth will hurt for life
Don't need to tell you that ain't right
Come now little boy don't you cry
'Cause the child in you is still alive

This moment of truth will hurt for life
Don't need to tell you that ain't right

Well, all right, well all right
Our lifetime love will be all right


Well, all right, so I'm going steady
It's all right when people say
That those foolish kids cant be ready
For the love that comes their way


Well, all right, well all right
We'll live and love with all our might
Well, all right, well all right
Our lifetime love will be all right"
Pop,"I lie awake the night through
With the memory, the memory of you
The memories of walks we used to take
The memories of moonlight on the lake
The memory of violets in the spring
The memories of songs we used to sing
The memory of dancing close to you
The memories of candle light for two
The memories of lips that used to thrill
The memories of tears of heartbreak him

(two roo roo...)

I lie awake the night through
With the memory, the memory of you

I remember the walks we used to take
I remember the moonlight on the lake
I remember the violets in the spring
And the songs we used to sing

The memory of counting stars at night
The memories of arms that held me tight
The memory of your last valentine
The memory of love that once was mine

(two roo roo...)

I lie awake the night through
With the memory, the memory of you
(the memory of you)
(the memory of you)
The memory of you"
Rock,"""Oh, Mrs. McGrath,"" the sergeant said
""Would you like to make a soldier of your son Ted
With a scarlet coat and a big cocked hat
Now Mrs. McGrath would you like that?""

With your too-ri-aa, fol-did-dle-di-aa,
too-ri-oo-ri-oo-ri-aa, too-ri-aa,
fol-did-dle-di-aa, too-ri-oo-ri-oo-ri-aa

Now Mrs. McGrath lived on the sea shore
And after seven years or more
She spied a ship coming into the bay
With her son from far away


""Oh captain dear, where have ye been?
You been sailing on the Mediterranean?
Have you news of my son Ted?
Is he living or is he dead?""

With your too-ri-aa, fol-did-dle-di-aa,
too-ri-oo-ri-oo-ri-aa, too-ri-aa,
fol-did-dle-di-aa, too-ri-oo-ri-oo-ri-aa

Then up came Ted without any legs
And in their place two wooden pegs
She kissed him a dozen times or two
And said ""My God Ted is it you""?
Now were ye drunk or were ye blind
When ye left yer two fine legs behind?
Or was it walking upon the sea
That wore your two fine legs away?""

With your too-ri-aa, fol-did-dle-di-aa,
too-ri-oo-ri-oo-ri-aa, too-ri-aa,
fol-did-dle-di-aa, too-ri-oo-ri-oo-ri-aa

Now I wasn't drunk and I wasn't blind
When I left my two fine legs behind
A cannonball on the fifth of May
Tore my two fine legs away

""My, Teddy boy,"" the widow cried
""Yer two fine legs were yer mother’s pride
Stumps of a tree wouldn't do at all
Why didn't ye run from the cannon ball?""

With your too-ri-aa, fol-did-dle-di-aa,
too-ri-oo-ri-oo-ri-aa, too-ri-aa,
fol-did-dle-di-aa, too-ri-oo-ri-oo-ri-aa

""All foreign wars I do proclaim
Live on blood and a mother’s pain
I’d rather have my son as he used to be
Than the King of America
And his whole Navy!"
Pop,"If your lips are moving, If your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby
If your lips are moving, If your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby

Boy, look at me in my face
Tell me that you're not just about this Bass
You really think I could be replaced
Nah, I come from outer space
And I'm a classy girl, I'mma hold it up
You're full of something but it ain't love
And what we got, straight overdue
Go find somebody new

You can buy me diamond earrings
And deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar
So goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye

I know you lie
Cause your lips are moving
Tell me do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young, but I ain't stupid
Talking around in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass, You gave me sweet talk
Saying how I'm your number one
But I know you lie
Cause your lips are moving
Baby don't you know I'm done

If your lips are moving, If your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby

Hey baby don't you bring them tears
Cause it's too late, too late baby
You only love me when you're here
You're so two-faced, two-faced babe

You can buy me diamond earrings
And deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar
So goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye

I know you lie

Rock,"So let the frozen sands crumble, crumble and fall
Yeah that's all right, I don't mind at all
Well let it all tumble right into the sea
Yeah that's all right, that's fine with me
Since you came down the line
I don't sleep at night
I got one thing on my mind
And so every day, every night
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
That's what I wanna do
'Cause you're so out of sight
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
That's what I wanna do

Well I lost my job at the Texaco station
Instead of pumpin' gas I dreamed of you
I got thrown out of my house
I got such a bad reputation
'Cause all I wanna do is be seen with you

They gave me my pay and said walk
I don't care what they say
Go ahead and let 'em all talk
Until the world falls apart
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
That's what I wanna do
Until they rip out my heart
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
That's what I wanna do

Bedtime, hold tight, love me just a little bit
All night, a little bit more
Tonight, tonight ...
Oh I don't know, I don't know
I don't understand itYou ain't pretty at all
But I come when you whisper
I run when you call
And baby I can't stand it
And baby that's all
Ridin' by your side in my car
Oh, oh I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
Darlin' don't you know
Oh, oh I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
Because I love you so

Rock,"They call him Mr. Outside
Cause he don't care
Mr. Outside
He's just havin' his fun
Mr. Outside
He's just looking out for No. 1

Well Mr. Outside
All your money and your power
Won't help you come the dark hour
Well kingdoms crumble
Unto your feet
You're lest another thief out on the street

Mr. Outside
Yeah he don't care
Mr. Outside
He's just having his fun
Mr. Outside
Oh looking out for No. 1

Dark glasses and money for hire

Mr. Outside
He's just having his fun
Mr. Outside

Oh little baby got no diamond ring
You cry cause you ain't got no pretty things
Them pretty things babe just look dumb
You gotta take 'em when they come

"
Rock,"(Rod Stewart & Ronnie Lane)

If I'm late, darling, don't hesitate
Just go without me and I'll see you there anyway
If I miss you at the station
I want you on that train

I don't want a sad sack
'Cause I'll be there come what may
Leave a message with the porter
Or leave it at the gate
Just let me know that you're aboard her
Just a word to know that you're safe

I walk from Maryland to Silvertown
I hoped to catch you in the street
I must have missed you by a moment dear
I tried the place we alway meet

So if I'm late darling, don't hesitate
Go on your own some
And I'll catch you there anyway
I might lose some time babe
But if I do
I'll make amends in an hour
"
Rock,"Another time, another place
If we met again would it be this way?
Knowing now what comes around is custom made
But those are in the wings
We'll wait for love to show it's face

And all I know is I wanna go on
If it means feelin' nothing
Only to find words are not enough
And I guess I played it wrong
Tell me now is there something I could of done
For the sake of love?

And if our love was just a play
About a ground scribbled on a page
Baby I would play the part of Joan of Arc
Strong enough to mend your heart
Tonight and every day

And all I know is I, I don't wanna go on
If it means feelin' nothing
Only to find that love is not enough
And I, I guess I played it wrong
Tell me now is there something I could of done
For the sake of love?

Heaven knows that love is hard enough
When the world belongs to those who don't feel as much
And heaven knows we don't need them anyway
It doesn't matter what they say about us

I let you slip away
Tell me now was there something I could of done
For the sake of love?
For the sake of love"
Pop,"I never dreamed I’d want you
You weren’t even even a friend
But I guess I’ve fallen
So this story can’t just end

Your love lifted me
Out of this world
With the love out of this world

I love you when I’m with you
Still I hate you when you’re gone
But I love you like no other
I love you with this song

Your love lifted me
Out of this world
So transported as the leaves to our lives unfurl
With the love out of this world"
Rock,"Here we go!

Power tripping your luck is switched
Oh, so now it's funny
When it's your turn to laugh
You go poke the running joke!

Scoring points with God
Get no perfect marks
But your grades keep falling
How you treat the weak is
Your true nature calling

Porn chick calls herself a therapist
Baby call it what it is
For all the money in the world
We'll go to war for backward heroes

Come to rescue you
Just to lien on you
With interests soaring
How you treat the weak is
Your true nature calling

Motherfucker, do you really care?
Motherfucker, do you really care?

Please believe
We live and breathe
Through native tongue and
Poetry
All those years we believed, yeah

Scoring points with God
Get no perfect marks
But your grades keep falling
How you treat the weak is
Your true nature calling

"
Pop,"If you see me and I look away
Please don’t ask me
There’s nothing to say about the way that I feel
It’s hard to conceal when it’s in my eyes
If I tell you that I’m doin’ fine
Please believe me
It may be a lie but I’ve got to move on
I’ve got to be strong
Now what else can I do?
Cause I’ve been
Wanting waiting hoping praying
Oh I feel like I’m suffocating
There’s nothing left to lose
If all that I have is the sweetest denial
If all I can give is the rest of my life
Then I’m over pretending
That I can survive without you
Thought I was stronger than love
But I guess that nobody’s immune
There’s a poison
That runs through my veins when I’m sleeping
And just like a secret
That I try to keep
I buried too deep
Like the memories of you
But I’m still here
Wanting waiting hoping praying
Oh I feel like I’m suffocating
There’s nothing left to lose
If all that I have is the sweetest denial..."
Rock,"It's hard being a man
living in a garbage pail
My landlady called me up, ooohhh
she tried to hit me with a mop

I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more, oh
I can't stand it anymore more

But if Candy would just come back
it'd be all right
Yeah, if Candy would just come back
it would be all right, come on baby

I live with thirteen dead cats
a purple dog that wears spats
They're all out livin' in the hall
and I can't stand it anymore

I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more

But if Candy would just come back
it'd be all right
Ooohhh, if Candy would just come back
it would be all right, be all right now

Ah, come on baby

I'm tired of living all alone
yeah, nobody ever calls me on the phone
But when, ah, things start getting bad, ah
I just play my music louder

I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it, I can't stand it, oh
I can't stand it, I can't stand it
I can't stand it, I can't stand it, no
I can't stand it, I can't stand it, oh
I can't stand it, I can't stand it
I can't stand it, I can't stand it
I can't stand it, I can't stand it
I can't stand it, I can't stand it

"
Rock,"So you heard
I crossed over the line
Do I have regrets?
Well, not yet
There are some,
some who give Blood
I give love
I give

Soon before the sun
before the sun
begins to rise
I know that I
I must give
so that I
I can live

There are some,
some whose give
twists itself to take
they mis-take
who, what made up the line
some say it was pain
or was it shame

Soon before the sun
before the sun
begins to rise
I know that I
I must give
so that I
I can live
Some
Some who give Blood.
I give love
I give

Pop,"This may be our last good night together
We may never pass this way again
Just let me enjoy it ‘til it’s over, for forever
Please don’t tell me how the story ends

See the way our shadows come together
Softer than your fingers on my skin
Someday this may be all we remember of each other
Please don’ tell me how the story ends

Never’s just the echo of forever
Lonesome as the love that might have been
Let me go on loving and believing ‘til it’s over
Please don’t tell me how the story ends"
Pop,"Yeah
Oh no
Oh no
Ohh
Yeah, yeah ...

They say that hate has been sent
So let loose the talk of love
Before that I thought a kiss
Baby give me one last hug

There's a moment I've been chasing
And I finally caught it out on this floor
Baby there's no hesitation
No reservation
By taking a chance and more
Ohh no, because

Its like an angel came by, and took me to heaven
Cuz when I stare in your eyes
It couldn't be better
Let the music blast
We gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all
Cuz this lifes too long
And this love's too strong
So baby know for sho'
And I'll never let you go

Ohhhh
I'll never let you go

Take my hand, let's just dance
Watch my feet, follow me
Don't be scared, girl I'm here
If you didn't know, this is loooovee
Ohhhh

Let the music blast
We gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all
Cuz this lifes too long
And this love's too strong
So baby know for sho'
And I'll never let you gooooo
Ohhh, ohhhh

I'll never let you go
Ohhhh

I'll never let you go
Yeah"
Pop,"This is not your playground
I'm not here for you to shoot me down
Preying on my weakness
Even when you're not around
Nothing lasts forever
But you're wrapped around my dna
And I'm hiding in the corner
As the wounded kid I was
Like it was yesterday
Like nothing's changed

All that you've done you see
Ever so quietly
Comes creeping back up on me
Haunting me, goading me
Why can't you let go of me?
I don't have the patience anymore

That's not me
I won't be the version of me
The one you think you're comfortable with
The one you think you had your fun with
If I can't trust myself
Why should I trust anyone else?

All that you've done you see
Ever so quietly
Keeps creeping back up on me

Pop,"I'm a writer and a lover
I'm a midwest music man
And I've been to a lot of places
But I'm gon' end where I began
I took class in carolina
Got high smoking joints
And now they know my name in paris

But I'll be buried in detroit
Next to my father, and my father's father too
I used to live in new york city
But baby that ain't no substitute
Not for my hometown
That place people avoid
I've made love in every city
But I'll be buried in detroit

I don't claim to be a prophet
I just speak my mind
I try to tell it like it is
And sometimes God makes it rhyme
I like my songs how I like my women
Honest and to the point
You see I got fucked up in stockholm

But I'll be buried in detroit
Next to my father, my father's father too
Had a spot in new york city
But baby that ain't no substitute
Not for my hometown
That place people avoid
I've made love in every city
But I'll be buried in detroit

You know I ain't gon' live forever
Baby it won't be long
At the wake they'll say ""he made a lot of mistakes
But he could write hell of a song""
And I made, I made killing
Though I never really was employed
I had a girl from san diego

But I'll be buried in
I killed a show in indonesia
But I'll be buried in
I made love in every city
But I'll be buried in detroit"
Rock,"It's no use pretending
What's done is done
And you can't turn back the clock
It's no use pretending
What you have said
Will stay inside my head
Oh it's over

I tried to please you
But all you could do
Was talk behind my back
Now I see through you
Nothing I could say or do
Would get to you

You've bitten off more than you can chew
Although I've got to say we're through
There's nothing I would rather do
Than be with you
There's more to you than meets the eye
I must admit you used to try
But since you've gone the other way
Your head is in the sky"
Pop,"I was counting down the minutes
I was wishin' on the stars
I was prayin' for a sign
And tryin' to beat the odds
I was dreamin' of you
From before I saw your face
And there you were
Waitin' for that day
Then you reached through the hurricane
When you baby you called my name

You broke through the storm
And you turned back the night
Baby you are the fire
Burnin' the midnight sky
And your love
Keeps taking me higher
Just when all hope was gone
Where the hero belongs...
There you were

Must have broken into heaven
Just to roll back the clouds
Were you on a mission
Were you seekin' me out
Was I that one in a million
Was I that one sacred kiss
That you couldn't chance
You just couldn't miss
Then you babe you whispered through the silent tears
When you, you swept away all my fears

You broke through the storm
And you turned back the night
Baby you are the fire
Burnin' the midnight sky
And your love
Keeps taking me higher
Just when all hope was gone
Where the hero belongs
There you were babe

Standin' in the middle of nowhere,
With your arms wide open and you,
You were the reason when there was no reason in my life
You're the reason in my life

You broke through the storm
And you turned back the night
Baby you are the fire
Burnin' the midnight sky
And your love
Keeps taking me higher
Just when all hope was gone
There you were babe

You broke through the storm
And you turned back the night
Baby you are the fire
Burnin' the midnight sky
And your love
Keeps taking me higher
Just when all hope was gone
Where the hero belongs...
There you were

Like the light in the eye of the storm
Tellin' me not to cry anymore
There you were
Where I watched my whole world fall apart
Shinin' through like on angel from afar
Oh like an angel

You broke through the storm
And you turned back the night
Baby you are the fire
Burnin' the midnight sky
And your love
Keeps taking me higher
Just when all hope was gone
There you were babe

Rock,"Our Father who art in heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth as in heaven
Give us today our daily bread
And forgive our sins
As we forgive each one of those
Who sins against us
And lead us not to the time of trial
But deliver us from evil
For Thine is the kingdom
The power and the glory

Let all the people say amen
in every tribe and tongue
Let every heart's desire be joined
To see the kingdom come
Let every hope and every dream
Be born in love again
Let all the world sing with one voice
Let the people say amen"

I replayed this moment for months
Alone in my head, waitin' for it to come
I wrote all your lines in the script in my mind
And I'd hoped that you'd follow it for once

I imagined myself in satin, the room was platinum and gold
I'd dance and catch your eye, you'd be mesmerized, oh
We'd find a corner there, your hands in my hair

I'm crazy, P.M.T and I'm young

don't hate me,

coz I'm mad about that thing that you do

oh baby,
just save me,
I'm giving it up for you

I can't help it,
you can't stop me
fillin it up with my new philosophy!
"
Rock,"My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness
pains my sense
As though of hemlock I had drunk
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk

'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot
But being too happy in thy happiness
That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees
In some melodious plot
Of beechen green, and shadows numberless
Singest of summer in full-throated ease

O for a draught of vintage, that hath been
Cooled a long age
in the deep-delved earth
Tasting of Flora and the country green
Dance, and Provencal song, and sun-burnt mirth

O for a beaker full of the warm South
Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene
With beaded bubbles winking at the brim
And purple-stained mouth
That I might drink
and leave the world unseen
And with thee fade away into the forest dim

Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget
What thou among the leaves hast never known
The weariness, the fever and the fret
Here, where men sit and hear each other groan

Where palsy shakes a few, sad
last gray hairs
Where youth grows pale
and spectre-thin, and dies
Where but to think is to be full of sorrow
And leaden-eyed despairs
Where beauty cannot keep
her lustrous eyes
Or new love pine at them beyond tomorrow

Away, away, I will fly to thee
Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards
But on the viewless wings of Poesy
Though the dull brain perplexes and retards
Already with thee tender is the night
And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne
Clustered around by all her starry fays

But here there is no light
Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown
Through verdurous glooms
and winding mossy ways

I cannot see what flowers are at my feet
Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs
But in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet
Wherewith the seasonable month endows

The grass, the thicket
and the fruit-tree wild
White hawthorn and the pastoral eglantine
Fast-fading violets
covered up in leaves
And mid-May's eldest child
The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine
The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves

Darkling I listen, and for many a time
I have been half in love with easeful Death
Called him soft names in many a mused rhyme
To take into the air my quiet breath

Now more than ever it seems rich to die
To cease upon the midnight with no pain
While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad
In such an ecstasy!

Still wouldst thou sing
and I have ears in vain
To thy high requiem become a sod

Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird
No hungry generations tread thee down
The voice I hear this passing night was heard
In ancient days by emperor and clown

Perhaps the self-same song that found a path
Through the sad heart of Ruth
when, sick for home
She stood in tears amid the alien corn
The same that oft-times hath
charmed the magic casements
Opening on the foam of perilous seas
in faery lands forlorn

Forlorn! the very word is like a bell
To toll me back from thee to my sole self
Adieu, the fancy cannot cheat so well
As she is famed to do, deceiving elf

Adieu, adieu, thy plaintive anthem fades
Past the near meadows
over the still stream
Up the hill-side
and now 'tis buried deep
In the next valley-glades
Was it a vision or a waking dream?
Fled is that music - do I wake or sleep?"
Rock,"Love is here, here to stay
love is here, here to stay
It gets proven every day
love is here, here to stay

They both love Chinese food, he hates to dress
he loves to play pinball, she wants to play next
She likes her novels long, he's into comic books
they're gilt-edged polymorphous urban but somehow it works

'Cause love is here, here to stay
love is here, here to stay
It gets proven every day
love is here, here to stay

She likes Truman Capote, he likes Gore Vidal
he likes Edgar Allan Poe, she's into Mean Joe Greene
She thinks eating meat's disgusting, he likes hot dogs
she's into Gestalt therapy
while est and the vest just make him ill
But love is here to stay

Love is here, here to stay
love is here, here to stay
It gets proven every day
love is here, here to stay
Love is here, here to stay
love is here, here to stay
It gets proven every day
love is here, here to stay

Rock,"Oh pretty baby, when you say my name
Kick off my shoes inside of my head
Feel my shadow how it says your name
Rocking like a roller coaster made of sin
I wanna make you scream, wanna make you shout
Hands all shaking and the power is out

Run your fingers through my head
Engine's overheating, gasoline in the air
Cadillac's Wagon ain't got no soul
Frame out of fire and out of control
Listen to the morning and scream and shout
Hands are shaking and the power is out

Red lights shining on a broken road
Sun's going down baby, I gotta get home
Your wheels are spinnin' underneath my thighs
I wanna taste your tongue, look me in the eyes
Wanna make you scream, wanna hear you shout
Hands all shaking and the power is out

Burn my hands in the fire
Burn my hands in the fire
I'm burning up
I'm burning up
I'm burning up
I'm burning up in the fire

I said oh pretty baby when you say my name
Kick off my shoes inside my head
See my shadow how it says your name
Rocking like a roller coaster made of sin
Wanna make you scream, wanna make you shout
Hands all shaking and the power is out

Hands all shaking and the power is out"
Rock,"Sundown, sundown
They're taking all the tents down
Where have you gone my handsome Billy?

Sundown, sundown
The carnival train's leaving town
Where are you now darling Billy?

We won't be dancing together on the high wire
Facing the lions with you at my side anymore
We won't be breathin' the smoke and the fire
On a midway

Hanging from the trapeze
My wrists waiting for your wrists
Two daredevils high up on the wall of death
You throwin' the knife that lands inches from my heart
Sundown

Moonrise, moonrise
The light that was in your eyes has gone away
Daybreak, daybreak
The thing in you that made me ache has gone to stay

We'll be riding the train without you tonight
The train that keeps on movin'
Its black smoke scorching the evening sky
A millions stars shining above us like every soul livin' and dead
Has been gathered together by a God to sing a hymn over your bones

Sun down, sun down
Empty are the fairgrounds
Where are you now handsome Billy?"
Pop,"Seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first
And the truth comes second
Just stop for a minute and
Smile

Why is everybody so serious
Acting so damn mysterious
You got your shades on your eyes
And your heels so high
That you can't even have a good
Time

Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that
Well pay them with love tonight

Chorus:
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

Ain't about the (ha) Cha-Ching Cha-Ching
Aint about the (yeah) Ba-Bling Ba-Bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

We need to take it back in time
When music made us all unite
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes
Am I the only one getting... tired?

Why is everybody so obsessed
Money can't buy us happiness
If we all slow down and enjoy right now
Guarantee we'll be feelin'
All right

Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that
Well pay them with love tonight





It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag"
Rock,"Maybe I didn't like to hear
But I still can't believe Speed Racer is dead
So then I thought I'd make some plans
But fire thought she'd really rather be water instead

And Peggy got a message for me
From Jesus
And I've heard every word that you have said
And I know I have been driven like the snow

This is cooling
Faster than I can
This is cooling
Faster than I can

But do I hate what she is
But do I want to be her
And don't we love something fresh
Anything new, virgin

Woman you got too many brambles
Hiding under these bushes
Woman you got too many brambles
But I always liked a good storm
I'm always good for a storm

So then love walked up to like
And said I know that you don't like me much
Let's go for a ride
This ocean is wrapped around that pineapple tree

And is your place in heaven
Worth giving up these kisses
These, these kisses

And Peggy got a message for me
From Jesus
And I've heard every word that you have said
And I know I have been driven like the snow, but

This is cooling
Faster than I can
Hey yes, faster than I can
Hey, this is cooling
This is cooling
"
Rock,"Staring in the mirror with two borrowed eyes
Looking for a part of me that's still alive
Waiting for my chest to fall and rise

Standing on the corner with my shirt tucked in
Summer turns to autumn
winter turns to spring
And it all flies by
Like a speeding train

Dead wishes on a broken chain
White roses in a dead man's dream
Down and out
With everything to lose
If these long dead wishes
Never do come true

Waiting for the night to come and chase away
All the flies hovering around my head
With my memories for a pillow
And all my regrets for a bed

Standing on the corner now I'm passed surprise
Yelling out a warning to some passer by
I stand just as God made me
And I lie down in disguise

Dead wishes on a burning lake
White roses for my soul to keep
Diving down with everything to win
If my long since sunken ship
Ever does come in

Down and down we all fall down
And that's how ancient mountains crumble

Time keeps moving slower
Like falling from the sun
Come and knock me over
I keep getting up
Throw a line down to me
Keep hanging on

Standing on the corner don't apologize
You don't have to bow your head or raise your eyes
Or pretend that you don't see me

Dead wishes on a broken chain
White roses in a dead man's dream
Down and out
With everything to lose
If these long dead wishes
These long dead wishes
Ever do come true

Down and down we all fall down
And that's how ancient mountains crumble"

Pop,"Are you ready boots?
Start walkin

Well officer I don't mind to say you do
Now your looking right where I thought

Legs come handy when laws in front of you

Chorus
These boots are made for walkin
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You believe you've stopped me for a reason (uh)
Now I'm pretending my bendings just for fun
You keep playing where I got you playing (yeah)
These double - D's initials work to run

Chorus

I'm the girl with the good boys who don't mean you no harm

Strut ya stuff come on

Hey ya'll
Wanna come and see something (uh uh, uh uh)

Tick tock all around the clock drop it
Push ya tush, like that

Rock,"You be you and let me be me
No strings attached emotionally
I wanna get a little crazy
That's puttin' it plain
You got the medicine and I got the pain.

When you just wanna feel good
Like the doctor said
One good dose of loving
It's gonna straighten out your head

(tag):
You got an open invitation
On that you can rely
You got a prepaid reservation
And that's the only way to fly.

Let's make love, the feeling is right
Just passing by like ships in the night
Oughta get a little friendly
There's no time like now
You bring the attitude and I'll show you how.

Anytime you're ready
Anytime at all
just come on over"
Rock,"I have a love and it's all that I have
Right or wrong, what else can I do ?
I love him, I'm his,
And every thing he is
I am, too.

I have a love and he's all that I need,
Right or wrong, and he needs me, too.
I love him, we're one.
There's nothing to be done.
Not a thing I can do

But hold him,
Hold him forever.
Be with him now
Tomorrow and all of my life.

When love comes so strong
There is no right or wrong.
Your love is your own.
"
Pop,"(Elliot Wolff / Howie Tee / Bryan Abrams / Mark Calderon / Kevin Thornton / Sam Watters)

Well there's not a bit of truth in what you hear
Just a whole lot of jealousy out there smearin'
My good name all over the place
Just to get you thinkin' that I'm two faced

But I would never go south
I was never dreamin' of anybody else
You're the only one I'd ever be with
I got a whole lot to say but babe the truth is

Chorus:
Ain't never gonna give you up
Ain't never gonna let you down baby
Ain't never gonna give you up
Hey hey hey hey
Yea yea yea
Ain't never gonna give you up
Yea yea yea
Ain't never gonna let you down baby

I wanna be right there for you so don't
Believe another word cause all those low girls
Only wanna put the split between us
They keep getting off on all the fuss
But I will always treat you
Just the way I always I'd do
You're the only one I'd ever be with
I got a whole lot to say but babe the truth is

Chorus

Baby don't you know that I want to be with you

Chorus"
Pop,"Hey baby
Hello
What's on your mind
I miss you so much
I miss you too
But you ain't gotta worry about a thing, éŒ­ause I'll be waitin' for you

Chorus:
I'll be waitin' for you
(Till the break of dawn)
Would you come back to me
(éŒ­ause you're better than the rest of them)
I'll be waitin' for you
(till the break of dawn)
Always, always

I woke up last night
You're the only one that's on mind
I can't imagine
You're not here with me
With me baby

I don't know what I would do
If my love wasn't meant for you
Girl you make me feel so good inside
Yes, you do

Chorus

Now my heart begins to break
Baby, why you so late
You know that I
That I do miss you
Miss you baby

Now that we found love
You're all I'm dreaming of
Girl you make me feel so good inside
Yes you do

Chorus

I'll be waitin' when you call me
I'll be here
Have no fear
Hurry home 'cause I need you
I won't deceive you
I'll never leave you

"
Pop,"Leanin' against the window of a white hotel room
Lookin' down at Dallas, shining in the heat
Honey when you move it's graceful as a pnther
Open up your lips and my heart skips a beat

You suffer so pretty like a ragged apostle
You burn oh so brightly like a soldering gun
And I gave my body and soul to relieve you
But now you have told me that I'm not the one

And if I'm not the one
Baby if I'm not the one

Who's gonna dive down to the floor of the ocean
Who's gonna save you from being alone
Who's gonna hold you when you cry in the nighttime
Who's gonna carry your heart
Your heart of stone

I believed my love
Could chase away your darkness
Was strong enough to fight all the demons in your dreams
(Little did I know the weight would pull me under
Living in your world is so much harder than it seems)

Bit if I'm not the one
Baby if I'm not the one

Who's gonna dive down to the floor of the ocean
Who's gonna save you from being alone
Who's gonna hold you when you cry in the nighttime
Who's gonna carry your heart
Your heart of stone

Alt verse lyric
(Little did I know it would pull me under
I watched us both come apart at the seams)"
Rock,"Sometimes I wish I knew your name
At times I want to say hello
But you seem so far away
To let my feelings show
And though I don't know what to say
I feel that someday soon one day
Love will place you by my side
And it shall be our guide

And then mañana sera se si
Means our love will always be
Something special and also true
Girl I long to be with you
Oh mañana sera se si
Means our love will always be
Something special and also true
Girl I long for you

When I have you by my side
You will always be my pride
Love so simple yet so sweet
I do think you're all I need
So I thought I'd let you know
That my heart forever grows
Closer to your warm embrace
Everytime I see your face

And then mañana sera se si
Means our love will always be
Something special and also true
Girl I long to be with you
Oh mañana sera se si
Means our love will always be
Something special and also true
Girl I long for you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And so mañana sera se si
Means our love will always be
Something special and also true
Girl I long to be with you
Oh mañana sera se si
Means our love will always be
Something special and also true
Girl I long for you

Do you know I don't know you
I wanna show you I do love you
That I do do, do love you
Oh babe, I think about you
Even though I don't know you
I wanna show you I do love you
And that I do do, I think about you
Oh babe, I do love you
Even though I don't know you
I wanna show you I do love you
I think about you
Oh do do, oh do do, oh do do

Chorus (2x)"
Pop,"Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of you
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me that's okay baby
Only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got
When you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby
Only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home"
Rock,"It's just a one dollar secret
A lover's secrets in the UK
Torn apart in the UK
In the dribble of May-Day
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry
And there's nothing inside
And there's nothing in mind
And only you
Rocket on thru the sky
It couldn't be done without dogs
It couldn't be once without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry

When the days were the days were the days boys
When blue ties were for the biggy guys
Frannie dressing down for the enemy
You saw him hangin' on the enemy
And there's no one in love
And there's nowhere to scream
And only you
Race on to wonder where
It couldn't be done without dogs
It couldn't be once without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry
You can't make love with money
You can't make mistakes with babies
Nothing looked good on you
That's how I liked you best
Now you're ready for the real McCoy

Deep in the heart of Cupid
Murders on the heels of love
Just the ghost of a story
Just a one dollar secret
Baby these were the sounds
Baby these were the sounds
And only you
Whisper these things aren't true
It couldn't be done with dogs
It couldn't be once without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry"

Rock,"I'm driving a big lazy car rushin' up the highway in the dark
I got one hand steady on the wheel and one hand's tremblin' over my heart
It's pounding baby like it's gonna bust right on through
And it ain't gonna stop till I'm alone again with you

A friend of mine became a father last night
When we spoke in his voice I could hear the light
Of the skies and the rivers the timberwolf in the pines
And that great jukebox out on Route 39
They say he travels fastest who travels alone
But tonight I miss my girl mister tonight I miss my home

Is it the sound of the leaves
left blown by the wayside
That's got me out here on this spooky old highway tonight
Is it the cry of the river
With the moonlight shining through
That ain't what scares me baby
What scares me is losing you

They if you die in your dreams you really die in your bed
But honey last night I dreamed my eyes rolled straight back in my head
And God's light came shinin' on through
I woke up in the darkness scared and breathin' and born anew
It wasn't the cold river bottom I felt rushing over me
It wasn't the bitterness of a dream that didn't come true
It wasn't the wind in the grey fields I felt rushing through my arms
No no baby it was you
So hold me close honey say you're forever mine
And tell me you'll be my lonely valentine
"
Rock,"Looking in the mirror
Harry didn't like what he saw
The cheeks of his mother,
the eyes of his father
As each day crashed around him
the future stood revealed
He was turning into his parents
The final disappointment

Stepping out of the shower
Harry stared at himself
His hairline receding the slight overbite
He picked up the razor to begin
his shaving and thought
- Oh, I wish I was different

I wish I was stronger
I wish I was thinner
I wish I didn't have this nose
These ears that stick out
remind me of my father
and I don't want to be reminded at all
The final disappointment

Harry looked in the mirror
thinking of Vincent van Gogh
and with a quick swipe lopped off his nose
And happy with that he made a
slice where his chin was
He'd always wanted a dimple
The end of all illusion
Then peering down straight
between his legs
Harry thought of the range of possibilities
A new face, a new life,
no memories of the past
and slit his throat from ear to ear

Harry woke up with a cough
the stitches made him wince
A doctor smiled at him
from somewhere across the room
Son, we saved your life
but you'll never look the same
And when he heard that
Harry had to laugh
And when he heard that
Harry had to laugh
Although it hurt Harry had to laugh
The final disappointment"
Rock,"Well, the night makes moves
And it shatters like broken glass
Better play it cool... better let it pass
Have you been screening your smokes?
And whispers in an all night bar
Better off as the fool
Than the owner of that kind of heart

They don't know you anyway
They don't know you and they don't watch you walk away
Just a nobody girl
With a radar to the scene
When the emptiness finds you
You find all the numbers you need
Say you follow your heart
Well, honey you're just being lost
Say you follow your gut
Well, how much would it cost?

They don't know you anyway
They don't know you
And they don't watch you walk away

You're nobody, girl
You're nobody, girl

You're a nobody, girl

The night plays games
And the people they come and go
Well, they trade in their pieces
For a late-night ride on your rodeo
If your horses could talk,
I wonder if they would complain
I know you're rested and ready
They've been going nowhere for days

They don't know you anyway
They don't know you,
They don't even mind the weight

Nobody, girl
You're nobody, girl
Nobody, girl

"
Rock,"one day you see a strange little girl look at you
one day you see a strange little girl feeling blue

she'd run to the town one day
leaving home and the country fair
just beware
when you're there
strange little girl

she didn't know how to live in a town that was rough
(i'm done thanking you)
it didn't take long before she knew she had enough
walking home in her wrapped up world
she survived but she's feeling old
and she found all things cold

strange little girl
where are you going?
strange little girl
where are you going?
strange little girl you really should be going.

walking home in her wrapped up world
she survived but she's feeling old
cuz she found all things cold

strange little girl
where are you going?
you really should be going.

Rock,"You wanna make me sick;
You wanna lick my wounds,
Don't you baby?

You want the badge of honour when you save my hide
But you're the one in the way
Of the day of doom, baby
if you need my shame to reclaim your pride

And when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists
I never did anything to you man
But no matter what I try
You'll beat me with your bitter lies
So call me crazy, hold me down
Make me cry; get off now baby-
It won't be long till you'll be
Lying limp in your own hand

You feed the beast I have within me
You wave the red flag baby you make it run run run
Standing on the sidelines waving and grinning
You fondle my trigger, then you blame my gun

And when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists
I never did anything to you, man
But no matter what I try
You'll beat me with your bitter lies
So call me crazy, hold me down
Make me cry; get off now, baby-
It won't be long till you'll be
Lying limp in your own hand"
Rock,"Everybody needs to cry some
Everybody can't be wise
Everybody needs some understanding
Understanding when you cry

Love doesn't always begin like this
Everybody knows
Love doesn't always end with a kiss
See I've been in love and I know
And now you've been in love and you know

Anyone who's ever hurt you
Anyone who's ever tried
Will only love you then desert you
Won't believe you when you cry

Rock,"Hey little girl is your daddy home
Did he go away and leave you all alone
I got a bad desire
I'm on fire

Tell me now baby is he good to you
Can he do to you the things that I do
I can take you higher
I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby
Edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley
Through the middle of my soul

At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running
Through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby
Edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley
Through the middle of my soul

Hey little girl is your daddy home
Did he go away and leave you all alone
I got a bad desire
I'm on fire"
Pop,"It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five-and-ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas (Christmas)
Everywhere you go
Now there's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in, the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon all the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Hmm, hmm

Oh, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas (Christmas)
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas (Christmas)

Christmas (Christmas)

Rock,"Well, she comes to me like a childhood soul
Or an old time friend I ain't seen so long
When she sings to me, it's like a loving song
She can be so sweet, she don't do me no wrong

You mean so much to me, baby
You know you drive me crazy
You mean so much to me, baby
I want you for my girl

Well, sometimes she's like a baby playing with a toy,
Then she's so much woman she makes me feel like a little boy
And when she comes to me, and she's all alone,
And she cries: ""Oh daddy, oh Daddy make me strong!""

That's when she means so much to me baby,
You know you drive me crazy
You mean so much to me, baby
I want you for my girl
"
Rock,"We left behind the busy crowd.
So it seems we slow down.
Meet me with a way out through the lies.
Nowhere, going nowhere in the fake yellow light.

Blame no one, blame no one.
Blame no one, blame no one.

The feelings change so fast.
Safety scares them away.
I can't bring myself to say it's my own advice I need.
Nowhere and then nowhere.
Living trapped inside the chase.

Blame no one, blame no one.
Blame no one, blame no one.

Our weakness is the same.
We need poison sometimes.
Our weakness is the same.
We need poison sometimes.
So take another drink with

Blame no one, blame no one.
Blame no one, blame no one.

Look in my eyes and blame no one."

Rock,"Looking down on a Junior Cowboy
I see myself at the end of each day
I'm feeling sad somehow
My rumble tumble days are over now

Took Loopy Loo to a paper hat party
And fought the kid who tried to take her away
I'm feeling sad somehow
My rumble tumble days are over now

Running away,you don't know,you don't care
Funny the way that we change

Playing spoof at the back of the schoolyard
With no thought for the rest of the day
I'm feeling sad somehow
'Cause my rumble tumble days are over now"
Rock,"Down by the Salley Gardens
My love and I did meet.
She passed the Salley Gardens
With little snow white feet.

She bid me take life easy
As the leaves grow on the trees.
But I being young and foolish,
With her did not agree.

In a field by the river
My love and I did stand.
And on my healing shoulder
She laid her snow white hand.

She bid me take love easy
As the grass grows on the weeds.
But I was young and foolish
And now I'm full of tears.

Down by the Salley Gardens
My love and I did meet.
She passed the Salley Gardens
With little snow white feet.

She bid me take love easy
As the leaves grow on the trees,
But I was young and foolish

Rock,"Lucky me
I guessed the kind of man
That you would turn out to be
Now I wish that I'd been wrong and then
I could remember to breathe
And all along the watchtower
The night horses and the black mares
Ready themselves for the outcome
For the strange times upon us

But what you didn't count on
Was another mother of
A mother revolution
But what you didn't count on
Was another mother of
A mother revolution
You could've have me
You could've have me
You could've have me
Right there beside you
You could've have me boy
You could've have me yeah
You could've have me
Right there beside you

A wife on loan in a cafe
In old El Paso
Next I go to
Seven Gates and my sister's Bass Bonanza
And all along her watchtower
The night horses and the black mares
Steady themselves for the outcome
For the strange days upon us

What you didn't count on
Was another mother of
A mother revolution"
Rock,"I'm into Sci-fi (Sci-fi,Sci-fi),
I'm into Sci-fi UFO,

That where I go,
The force will go,

I leave my Asimov,
Closed on the shelf.

Do you dig Einstein? (Einstein,Einstein),
Yeah, but only relatively,
Well it's a fine time,
To take a bash,
At his theories,
I think a Star War's,
headed this way,
We'll go to Mars,
We can work, rest and play.
I'm into Sci-fi (Sci-fi,Sci-fi),
I'm into Sci-fi UFO,

It's an agent from Mars,
And he's calling me from the moon,
It's there in the stars,
I've got a gig there in June.

I'm into Sci-fi (Sci-fi,Sci-fi),
I'm into Sci-fi UFO,

Hello Hello,

Pop,"Let all that's simple pass you by
Let all that lives be free to die
We're all, we're all key to life
Face all that rage and history
It makes no sense to you and me
We're all, we're all free to fight

I broke all my vows, my common sense
Says find vocation somewhere else

This should've been so beautiful
Should've been my proudest moment
How to have and lose you all
How to be a disappointment
Save your cheers and my applause
I never was worth fighting for
This should've been so beautiful
Been so beautiful
It could've been so beautiful
Tonight

Lay all that's sinful down to rest
May all our judgements be confessed
We're all, we're all guilty now
Drink for the crowd not for yourself
'Til someone hears your cry for help
Let's all, let's all take a bow

I spent all my mind on making sense
It made no difference in the end

This should've been so beautiful
Should've been my proudest moment
How to have and lose you all
How to be a disappointment
Save your cheers and my applause
I never was worth fighting for
This should've been so beautiful
Been so beautiful
It could've been so beautiful

Tonight I close my eyes and I am somebody else
Tonight I close my eyes and I don't need any help
Every moment of laughter
Every moment I fear
Every moment that you're not here
This should've been so beautiful, so beautiful, been so beautiful
This should have been so beautiful, been so beautiful

This should've been so beautiful
Should've been my proudest moment
How to have and lose you all
How to be a disappointment
Save your cheers and my applause
I never was worth fighting for
This should've been so beautiful
Been so beautiful
It could've been so beautiful

I once knew a hot girl
Past the mission
They're closing every hour
Past the mission
I smell the roses

Better
Better
Everyone wanted something from him
I did too but I shut my mouth

I wonder if I can take this hurt
I'm going through

There will not be sunny days
Life's gonna bring down some rain
But after it's over
I'll be that much stronger for the pain
So even when I'm sad
I know every day I have is still beautiful
Still beautiful

There've been times in my life
When all of the skies were blue and were so wide open
But lately all of my dreams seem so out of reach
And everything feels so broken
But it can't last too long
So I just keep on holding on

There will not be sunny days
Life's gonna bring down some rain
But after it's over
I'll be that much stronger for the pain
So even when I'm sad
I know every day I have is still beautiful

But I wanna cry sometimes
I'm gonna hurt sometimes
But it takes the good and the bad
The happy and sad to make you feel alive

There will not be sunny days
Life's gonna bring down some rain

I'll be that much stronger for the pain

With no money and the cupboard’s bare

Rock,"There's a simple escape, it covers any mistake,
Always have a good distraction.
If you can keep the debate, he said she said rage,
They'll forget whatever happened.
We devide, we take aside, spinning on forever,

Run, slow down, run, we're all waiting,
Waiting, in the same line.

Use your head to prepare, a real fight's not declared,
A symbol doesn't cause your problem.
Take a walk see who cares, it only works if you're scared,
Try the fear and you have lost.
Pick someone, anyone, no one ever questions.

Run, slow down, run, we're all waiting,
Waiting, in the same line.

Run, slow down, run, we're all waiting,
Waiting, in the same line.

Run, slow down, run, we're all waiting,
Waiting, in the same line."
Rock,"Searchinâ€™, Iâ€™m always searchinâ€™
Searchinâ€™ for my beloved
Iâ€™m gonna keep on searchinâ€™ â€˜cause
I need your love, yea
Listen, my heart is callinâ€™
Longing to have you near me
Please believe me what Iâ€™m sayinâ€™
is true
Every morning I wake up to you
Searchinâ€™, searchinâ€™, searchinâ€™,
searchinâ€™
Every night my thoughts return to
calling you
Lover, donâ€™t keep me waiting
You must hear what Iâ€™m saying
Iâ€™m gonna keep on searchinâ€™ till I win
your love
I can almost hear her gentle voice
Searchinâ€™, searchinâ€™, searchinâ€™,
searchinâ€™
I can almost hear her smile of light
Searchinâ€™, searchinâ€™, searchinâ€™,
searchinâ€™
I can almost feel the love reach out"
Pop,"(Love. Once you've tasted love) x 4

Don't be sold a dream. Remember how the past has been
Don't be led to believe thias one's for you
Calculate your needs. I see there's room to plant your seeds
Don't decide till you see how the others have grown

Once you've tasted love it is just the beggining of a new world
Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in
Once you've tasted love

Still too early to know. Give them time and they will grow
Don't believe that the first's the one for you
Most will grow to be tall, others will break and fall
Keep your eye on the strongest head of them all

Once you've tasted love it is just the beggining of a new world
Once you've tasted love it is just the beggining
Your head is spinning
Once you've tasted love

Once you've tasted love it is just the beggining of a new world
Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in
Can't control your mind and your head is still spinning
Once you've tasted love is just the beggining
Once you've tasted love

Once you've tasted love, you know is good
Come taste my love
You know you should

RAP:
Came into my world and the badness dissapeared
Take my hand, don't be afraid, I'm gonna work off all your fears
It feels so nice to be with you. Us two, we feel like a glove
When I see your eyes I realise you too have tasted love

Once you've tasted love, you know it's good
Come taste my love
"
Rock,"Little girl, I love when she talks to me
Got to smile, when she walks that walk with me
I want the girl, but I want a lot
Might cross my mind, but that's where it stops

Ohhhh
That bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of me
I said no, that bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of me
I said no, that bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of me
I said no, that bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of-part of-part of me

I love the girl, I'm lovin' the dress she wears
She's got a hold, got a hold of me neck, oh yeah
I wanna cry, the way that she moves
I want the girl, but not what she's going through

Ohhhhh
That bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of me
I said no, that bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of me
I said no, that bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of me
I said no, that bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of-part of-part of me

She was so friendly, I had one too many
But now that they tell she was rubbing up against me
But I swear, never meant a thing, she was just a
fling
There's no other woman who does it like you

That bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of me
I said no, that bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of me
I said no, that bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of-part of-part of me"
Pop,"No picnic no barbecue out in the back
A yard for parked cars left to rot and forget
For chained-up mad dogs for garbage to sit
Get lost get lost a part from it

I can't see through it
But i can see past
With me with me always
Without going back

Just people and buildings
Not city or town
Great lake crooked river
Flat land water burns
The air not smoke
It tears the eye
Home is where you live
Home is where you'll die

I can't see through it
But i can see past
With me with me always
Without going back

In a glacial slide
Over ice mirrored glass
In a slip and past times
Are in the future brought back
Reflected reflected reflected
Every footstep

No walk in the park
No there is nowhere
No place can replace
What a clear eye reveals
Soft and hard shaped like a wheel
Made me of rubber made me of steel

I can't see through it
But i can see past
With me with me always
Without going back

Rock,"When I ask you if everything is alright
You whisper ""Don't worry"" and you shut out the light
Now black is black in this bed we're laying
And I wanna believe the words that you're saying

CHORUS:
But your eyes look like a leavin' train
They keep on dragging me down
Your eyes look like a leavin' train
They keep on draggin'
They keep on draggin'
They keep on draggin' me down

Well I did anything just to try to get close to you
I took it step by step like a man's supposed to
Tell me now, is this my
Is this my contrition
To have the love that I longed for fill me with suspicion


(CHORUS)

Now it's tellin' time, oh my little sister
Now can I believe the words, the words of love you whisper
Is my train in vain, has my soul gone to waste
Am I just a victim of, a victim of my lost faith

(CHORUS)
"
Rock,"Mad, you just make me mad
I hate your silent breathing in the night
Sad, you make me sad
when I juxtapose your features I get sad

I know I shouldn't had someone else in our bed
but I was so tired, I was so tired
who would think you'd find a bobby pin
it just makes me mad, makes me mad
It just makes me, makes me -

- Mad

Glad, when I'm gone you're glad
that overwhelming tension dissipates
Oh, tad, you think I'm a baby
nobody likes to here, Why don't you grow up at dawn

I know I shouldn't had someone else in our bed
but I was so tired, so tired
who would think you'd find a bobby pin
it makes me mad, makes me mad
Don't you know it just makes me -

- Mad
it just makes me mad

Dumb, you're dumb as my thumb
in the wistful morning you throw a coffee cup at my head
Scum, you said I'm scum
what a very lovely and feminine thing to do

Bark, why don't you just bark
sit, come, stay are the perfect words meant for you
Ah, ass, you says I'm an ass
you better call 911 just I'm gonna hold you tight

I know I shouldn't had someone else in our bed
but I was so tired, so tired
you said you're out of town for the night
and I believed in you, I believed you
And I was so tired, it makes me so mad
it makes me so -

- Mad
it makes me so mad
It just makes me mad
it makes me mad
It makes me mad
it makes me mad
It makes me mad
It makes me mad, ah
dumb

Pop,"It’s the morning after last night
I got in late and you were up for a fight
Oh i brought up some things that you didn’t like
You said get out, i said that i just might

Sometimes i feel like we’re not gonna make it
Sometimes we act like we really hate this
But we couldn’t replace this

Let’s face it, it’s true
Yeah, we can both be cruel
Yeah, we could both be fools
I play that game as weel as you
And you, you treat me the way you do
And act like you never knew
That i pretend that i don’t love you too
I don’t love you too
I don’t love you too
You know i do

Why is it when we fight that you look your best
I know it’s hot but could you wear any less
Well i won’t be there so who you trying to impress
You’re making damn sure that i don’t have to guess
Sometimes i swear that we just wanna break
Sometimes i swear that we’re not gonna take it
Yeah i might as well face it
We might as well face it

It’s true
Yeah, we can both be cruel
Yeah, we could both be fools
I play that game as well as you
And you, you treat me the way you do
And act like you never knew
That i pretend that i don’t love you too

We play the roles
Yeah, we put on a show
Both of us act like we’re ready to let go
But i know i miss it all
And it’s too far to fall

You know it’s true
Yeah, we can both be cruel
Yeah, we could both be fools
I play that game as well as you
And you, you treat me the way you do
And act like you never knew
That i pretend that i don’t love you too
I don’t love you too
I don’t love you too
But i do, you know i do yeah yeah
You know that i woah-oh-oh
You know that i woah-oh-oh
You know that i do, i do love you."
Pop,"He who asks for a friend must first prove himself friendly
Trials will come will you be fair weathered or will you be steady
Surely, firmly, are you my friend?

We were close
Closer than most
More than friends nothing could come between us and then
Arguments and experience
Came creepin in how long has it been

Didn't want you to leave
We couldn't agree
So I said to you stop talkin to me
That's where we left and now I'm reconsidering
I did the wrong thing girl listen to me

Tell me what's up (what's up)
I've had enough (enough)
How do we get back on telling you sorry
My mom said that's how you keep a friend, keep a friend (keep a friend)
Tell her you're sorry when you're wrong
That's how you keep a friend
That's the way you keep a friend (that's how you keep a friend)
That's the way you keep a friend (that's how you keep a friend)

I told you things I never told nobody
We shared everything
Somebody told you I was in town
Where was I, had you gotten a reply
I apologize wish you'd come around

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Can't even remember why we feel apart
But I'm so glad we got back together
Girl you're like a sister to me
So much more than a friend
So make sure it don't happen again

[Chorus]

What I gotta do to put this thing back together [repeat]"
Rock,"If there's rage inside you so you cannot think
spit it out
If you get so angry that you cannot speak
spit it out
Talk to him or her or it
and tell them where they can put it
Spit it out, spit it out
You got to talk to him or her or it
and take aim with your mouth and spit
Spit it out, spit it out

If you get worked over at your job
spit it out
If a taxi almost runs you down
spit it out
You got to take aim with your mouth and speak
and give it to them right between the teeth
Spit it out, spit it out
Talk to him or her or it
and take aim with your mouth and spit
Spit it out, spit it out

Spit it out
Hey, hey, hey

If you're patient and you have the time
spit it out
Wait till they're on the decline
spit it out
The Chinese say you meet the hard with the soft
the Yin with the Yang, the down with the up, oh
Spit it out, spit it out
You got to grab that dumb he, she or it
and give it to them right between the teeth
Spit it out, spit it out

Spit it out, babe, spit it out
Hey

Rock,"I Can't See New York

From here
no Lines are drawn
From here
no lands are owned
13,000 and Holding
swallowed in the purring
of her Engines
tracking the Beacon here
""is there a Signal
there on the other side""
on the other side?
what do you mean
the side of what things?

and you said
and you did
and you said
you would find me here
and you said
and you would find me
even in Death
and you said
and you said
You'd find me

But I can't see New York
as I'm circling down
through white cloud
falling out and I know
his lips are warm
but I can't seem to find
my way out
my way out

I can't see New York
as I'm circling down
through white cloud
falling out and I know
his lips are warm
but I can't seem to find
my way out
my way out
of this Hunting ground

From here
crystal meth
In metres of millions
In the end all we have,
soul blueprint.
and did we get lost in it
do we conduct a search for this
""from the other side""
from the other side?
what do they mean
side of what things...

falling out and I know
his lips are warm

I can't see New York

I know your lips are warm

Pop,"I've been practicing all day
Now the words I've meant to say are gone
I promissed that i wouldn't cry
Told myself i have to try and hold on

The truth, i lied
I hate myself inside
And why
I played the game and paid the price

I never looked back
I never cried, never tried to wonder why
I'll be on my own
I never doubt, never shout
Or wonder how
I'll never be lonely
Until this time, this time
This time I will

I've been wide awake on night
There's no sight of sleep inside my mind
The headlight shadows scares my wall
I convince myself you'll call in time

The truth, i lied
The girl in me has died
And why?
I played the game and paid the price

I never looked back
I never cried, never tried to wonder why
I'll be on my own
I never doubt, never shout
Or wonder how
I'll never be lonely
Until this time, this time
This time I will

This time I will
Be yours completely
This time i'll make sure you
Don't hate me
This time I know
This time i can
This time I will

I never looked back
I never cried, never tried to wonder why
I'll be on my own
I never doubt, never shout
Or wonder how
I'll never be lonely
Until this time, this time"
Pop,"I cleaned out your dresser, found some joints
My sister smoked 'em, I didn't see the point
And everyone keeps sayin' that I look just like you
Life don't seem so alone anymore

The day my daddy died, I damn near quit the band
The day my daddy died, I held my mama's hand
I cried my tears, then dried 'em up
Put my face inside my hands
The day my daddy died, I became a man

The cops came, they did not take off their shoes
People hug me, I smell like 10, 000 perfumes
Gave away the wheelchair, you're gone, but I'm still here
January in Detroit is cold as fuck

The day my daddy died, I damn near quit the band
The day my daddy died, I held my mama's hand
I cried my tears, then dried 'em up
Put my face inside my hands
The day my daddy died, I became a man
The day my daddy died, I became a man

I love you a lot
I love you, too
Remind me to let you run away if you need to run places, like the basement. I mean, that's what it's a part, isn't it? Being an individual
Yeah, letting people go
Yeah
Remind me to let you go, too, if you need to
Absolutely
I love you
I love you so much. You're gonna put that into a song?"
Pop,"I went out to the club the other night
To, you know, dance with my bitches
That guy was there again
He's like
I'm sorry for what I said last weekend
I told him I didn't mind, which was a lie
But I was equally sorry
And I didn't want to apologize
It was just a drunk text
In my head I was writing a fiction of us
Behind my eyes, I was begging for
Things my lips could never ask
And my mouth kept pouring
Desperate clauses of random intent
He asked me if he could text me later
After the club
He hands me another shot of vodka
And I say, sure

I'm on the dance floor when I get a text from adam
I'm too lazy to type, so I send him a photo I took up a dancer's skirt
And tell him to come and get it
Not realizing what I had just said
Later on, she comes up to me
Holds up her phone screaming at me and I say
I'm sorry, it was just a drunk text

I should've known they knew each other
No one is safe in the twitter sphere anymore
You take the word sex, and mix it with texting
It's called sexting
When you add drunk sexting
The words just don't make sense

It's a hot mess of misspelled obscenities,
Body parts, run on questions
I'm not sure what it means to ask

I get a text from my best friend
She's upstairs getting bottle service
She's like
This guy wants you to wet your lips with this bottle
He wants me to bring more girls up
Like he's some kind of pimp
Are you fucking kidding me?
It's just another moment
When one stupid reply can lead to the walk of shame
And I'll be damned if I end up in some lame diner after this
With last night's lingerie in my purse
It's just a drunk text
It's just a drunk text
This is the last time I ever drink and text
It's jut a drunk text
It's just a drunk text"
Pop,"Caught in the eye of a storm
Where we are born
No truth is spoken
Seems so long ago
And you really don't know
How you got broken

Feel me

Give a little bit of love for your people
But save a little bit of love for yourself
Have a little bit of trust in the way you feel
And see your heart melt

Send a little bit of hope down the airwaves
Find a little bit of gold, it might help
You've got to have a little bit of faith in everything you know
Then let your heart melt

Now is your time to rise
The one you can fly
I know why you sent me

Feel me

Give a little bit of love for your people
But save a little bit of love for yourself
Have a little bit of trust in the way you feel
And see your heart melt

Send a little bit of hope down the airwaves
Find a little bit of gold, it might help
You've got to have a little bit of faith in everything you do
Then watch you heart
Feel your heart melt

Send a little bit of hope down the airwaves
Find a little bit of gold, it might help
You've got to have a little bit of faith in everything you know
Then let your heart
Feel your heart melt"
Rock,"I can not resist your perfect skin
Red lips as the devil
The flames of hell inside your eyes


There's a good place beside her
I don't nothing to say I just gonna obey
She is the law
The law of this love

My dear mistress
The one love's by me
She gonna make you beg
She gonna tread your heart


My dear mistress
The one love's by me
She gonna make you beg
She gonna tread your heart

Nothing gonna stop this girl
She gonna turn you
in your little slave boy
who loves your dear mistress
A little slave boy to make whatever she wants
She gonna make you scream
and she loves see your tears
If you don't believe in me
she gonna show you"
Rock,"Like a gift from the heavens
It was easy to tell
It was love from above
That could save me from hell
She had fire in her soul
It was easy to see
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air
As she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands

And we sang a, away, away, away
And the voices rang like the angels sing
And singing a, away, away, away
And we danced only into the night
And we danced only into the night

Like a piece to the puzzle that falls into place
You could tell how we felt from the look on our faces
We were spinning in circles with the moon in our eyes
No room left to move in between you and I
And we forgot where we were
And we lost track of time
And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night

And we sang a, away, away, away
And the voices rang like the angels sing
And singing a, away, away, away
And we danced only into the night
And we danced only into the night
And we danced only into the night

Like a gift from the heavens
It was easy to tell
It was love from above
That could save me from hell
She had fire in her soul
It was easy to see
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air as she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands

And we sang a, away, away, away
And the voices rang like the angels sing
And singing a, away, away, away
And we danced only into the night
A, away, away, away
And the voices rang like the angels sing
And singing a, away, away, away
And we danced only into the night
A, away, away, away
A, away, away, away
Singing a, away, away, away
And we danced only into the night"
Rock,"I hear your heartbeat but you're never there
Like a mirage, you haunt me everywhere
All day long
I burn for you, lonely in the night
I tried to live alone, but I just can't get it right
Ya' know that, this town's like a Painted Desert
Dead heat, movin' in the city
I'm lost in a Painted Desert
In a Painted Desert without you

I've done some thinkin', now that you're not here
I know your reasons, and they're still not clear
All I'm sure of is what I got to lose
I tried to be a better loser, but it's just no use

Ya' know that this town's like a Painted Desert
Dead heat, movin' in the city
I'm lost in a Painted Desert
In a Painted Desert without you

Walkin' in the sundown, I search in vain
Waitin' on the wind that whispers out your name
Through concrete canyons echoing a world of other faces
No direction looks like home
Where is my oasis?

Ya' know that this town's like a Painted Desert
Dead heat, movin' in the city
I'm lost in a Painted Desert
In a Painted Desert without you
In a Painted Desert without you
Where is my oasis?

Rock,"Well look out Mama your little girl she has changed
She cut her baby curls
and she's got her act rearranged
Look out Daddy what she needs now
she can't find at home
Oh Rickie wants a man of her
She wants a man of her
Rickie wants a man of her own

Mama says her little girl won't talk to her anymore
She just goes in her room, turns on the radio and shuts
the door
She's got her own bathroom, TV, stereo, extension phone
Oh, but Mama, Rickie wants a man of her
She wants a man of her
Rickie wants a man of her own

Well Daddy says when he drop her off Friday night at the
gym
She slides way down in the front seat
So the kids won't see her with him
She don't do no work
She won't tell nobody when she's coming home
And she makes poor Daddy wait down on the corner
At midnight all alone

Well Daddy's pullin' out his hair
He says that girl ain't got no direction
She don't care to bring her boyfriends home
to pass Daddy's inspection
Now we're left peeking through the curtains
Everytime that we hear a horn blow
Well I guess Rickie wants a man of her own

Mama says: ""Son, talk to her, she'll listen to you""
Yeah, she listens real nice and she does what she wants
to do
Well Daddy says: ""She wears her jeans so tight
Well, you change 'em or you're staying home""Ah, but daddy, Rickie wants a man
of her
She wants a man of her
Rickie wants a man of her own
She's almost grown

Rickie wants a man of her
She wants a man of her
Rickie wants a man of her own

It's about your style (Ohhhhhhhh)
That drives me wild
It's the sexy things you're doing

Come and dance with me tonight
Feel the rhythm deep inside
Touch me now
You could be my casanova

It's about your kiss (Ohhhhhhh)
It's about your lips
It's about the way you move your body
It's about your style (Ohhhhhhhh)
That drives me wild
It's the sexy things you're doing

Come and dance with me tonight
Feel the rhythm deep inside
Touch me now

Pop,"Had you bet all your chips in an insane love?
Were you honest, but someone, your heart, broke?
Cannot you understand why everything seemed a joke?
Were you feeling trapped in a cage?
Are you sure that you know who is to blame?
Do you think that this pain will never end? Think again

Do you really need that romance?
Are you sure you need a second chance?
I think you can find something better
If you are single, what does it matter?
Just stop putting you down
Start from the ground

Love won't die
At no time
Break your chains and leave the grief behind
In real life, we must learn to fall and rise
Love won't die
That is right
Sometimes you need to see the good in goodbye
Live it up and stop being so blind

Can't you stop listening to sad songs?
Did you ever think that for you everything goes wrong?
Do you still wonder why they are gone?
Do you still remember of those moments you two?
Didn't you realize where it all turned blue?
Did you ever think that love was not for you?

Do you really need that romance?
Are you sure you need a second chance?
I think you can find something better
If you are single, what does it matter?
Just stop putting you down
Start from the ground

Love won't die
At no time
Break your chains and leave the grief behind
In real life, we must learn to fall and rise
Love won't die
That is right
Sometimes you need to see the good in goodbye
Live it up and stop being so blind"

And I love you being around, i say it again i'm not fucking around,

You´re living your dream

Play the game; take the blame for the power and the fame

Sell your life; sell your soul telling everyone you know

You´re living your dream



And you know that you´re good

Cause they told you you could be

The next best superstar

And you know you can sing

And you´ll do anything to be

The next best superstar

You´re the next best superstar



Make a joke; do the show, where does all the money go?

You´re living your dream

Crack a smile in denial; throw your morals on the fire

You´re living your dream

Sell your life; sell your soul telling everyone you know

You´re living your dream



And you know that you´re good

Cause they told you you could be

The next best superstar

And you know you can sing

And you´ll do anything to be

The next best superstar

You´re the next best superstar



Now you´re broken

And how they brought you down

So now you´re crawling out



And you know that you´re good

Cause they told you you could be

The next best superstar

And you know you can sing

And you´ll do anything to be

The next best superstar



And you know that you´re good

Cause they told you you could be

The next best superstar

And you know you can sing

And you´ll do anything to be

Pop,"I'll be riding it
I'll be riding it

Wanna make some music
To take me in and out of my head
Get into my groove
in time with my body instead
And when the bass kicks in
I can feel my song beginning
Boy your lovin' gets me high
Cos you're the only one
Who can pump it loud the way I like

(Chorus)
You're a DJ I'm a song
Take me out and turn me on
Let yourself go.
Ah you're riding it
Chicas bumping to the beat
From the side and underneath
Yeah my body's where this party's at
I'll be riding it
When you're spinning in
I'll be riding it

Here's a little rude and nasty
His tempo was an overload
He has jiggy with it here
but all I wanna do is vogue
And when the bass kicks in
I can dance like no one's watching
It's funny kinda feeling
Cos you're the only one
Who can pump it loud the way I like

You're a DJ I'm a song
Take me out and turn me on
Let yourself go
I'll be riding it
Chicas bumping to the beat
From the side and underneath
Yeah my body's where this party's at
I'll be riding it
When you're spinning in
I'll be riding it
When you're spinning in
I'll be riding it

And when the bass kicks in
I can dance like no one's watching
It's funny kinda feeling
Cos you're the only one
Who can pump it loud the way I like

You're a DJ I'm a song
Take me out and turn me on
Let yourself go

Chicas bumping to the beat
From the side and underneath
Yeah my body's where this party's at

You're a DJ I'm a song
Take me out and turn me on

Rock,"If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you.
When mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and
me.

Kind woman, I give you my all, Kind woman, nothing more.

Little drops of rain whisper of the pain, tears of loves lost in
the days gone by.
My love is strong, with you there is no wrong,
together we shall go until we die. My, my, my.
An inspiration is what you are to me, inspiration, look... see.


And so today, my world it smiles, your hand in mine, we walk the
miles,
Thanks to you it will be done, for you to me are the only one.
Happiness, no more be sad, happiness....I'm glad.
If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you.
When mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and
me."
Rock,"As I look around me I see the world
in a different light
Everything is changing and it happened
one night
Changing for the better and it starts
with you and me
So we'll sing our song together and forever
we'll be free

Sing a song of freedom
people together everybody sing
Sing a song of freedom each and everyman
People come together all across the land

If you're looking for an answer
it's very close hand
Just take a look around you and
then you'll understand
Clap your hands together and let
me hear the sound
It's the time for liberation so pass
the world around"

We knew this day would come
Take a breath
Breathe me in
I'm so scared
If you leave then
Wish we could both just run

Wish we could put it off
But we can't stop time
Seem the clock is running too fast
And now I'm feeling lost
And I can read your mind
So you don't have to ask

You know I'll wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Yeah, I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding on to
No matter how far
Do you know I can't live without my heart?
I hope you come home soon (soon)
You know,I'll wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Yeah, I'll wait

Make some calls
I have to do
Write you letters
Just to prove
You're the only thing on my mind
I know it's hard but we'll get through
Just hold on
I promise you
Soon you'll be here by my side

Wish we could put it off
But we can't stop time
Seems like the clock is running way too fast
And now I'm feeling lost
I can read your mind
So you don't have to ask,oh no

You know I'll wait for you

Rock,"Bells will be ringing, the glad - glad news
For what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone and I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again
Oh, crowds will be singing Silent Night
Christmas carols by candlelight

Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night

Friends and relations, send salutations
As sure as the stars shine above
Yes it's Christmas, Christmas my dear
It's the time of the year -- time of the year
To be with the one you -- the one you really love

Oh won't you tell me, we'll never grow old

Christmas and New Years will find you home
They'll be no more sorrow, no more grief and pain
Because I'll be happy that it's Christmas once again

Please come home for Christmas baby
They'll be no more sorrow, no more grief and pain
Because I'll be happy, Lord I'll be so happy
Happy once again

From the album ""True Love"""
Rock,"I can't give you all my dreams
Nor the life I live.
You and I know what friendship means,
That's all we got to give.

Who will take your dreams away
Takes your soul another day.
What can never be lost is gone,
It's stolen in a way.

Please, don't stand too close to me,
Can you hear my heart ?
Take my warmth and lean on me
When we're not apart.

Now our mission is complete
And our friends are here. (?)
Evil things brought down by the light,

Rock,"O come all ye faithful,
Joyful and triumphant.
O come ye to Bethlehem.
Come and behold him,
Born the king of angels,

Oh come let us adore him,
Oh come let us adore him,
Oh come let us adore him,
Venite Venite Adoremus Dominum,
Venite Venite Adoremus Dominum.

Sing choirs of angels,
Sing in exaltation.
Oh sing all ye citizens
Glory to God in the highest.

Oh come let us adore him,
Oh come let us adore him,
Venite Venite Adoremus Dominum,
Venite Venite Adoremus Dominum.

Oh come let us adore him,

Rock,"So, it's how the story goes.
And we come to the scene where I'm holding you close.
She moves, moves like a thin dulling blade
Cuts, all the words that I said.
The only difference is,
The only difference is,
The truth --
The truth is I miss you.

Cry on demand.
How'd you learn to?
Cry on demand.
Teach me if you want to.
Though you don't have to.
I just close my eyes and think of you.

Real. Real like a plastic bouquet.
That thrives on the smoke from an old fireplace.
And dies every night with her face on the news.
Nobody cries, they just smoke and stare and their shoes.
The only difference is,
The only difference is,
Nobody can cry --
It's hard to do.
For most folks, without a reason why.

Cry on demand.
How'd you learn to?
Cry on demand.
Why would you want to?
Just close your eyes and think of me.
I take back everything I said.
She can't hurt me, and I can't hurt you.
It's like were already dead.
Cry on demand.
Why would you want to?
Cry on demand.
Teach me if you want to.
Though you don't have to.
I just close my eyes and think of you.
"
Rock,"I&acute;m looking up, x5
But when I look at you I&acute;m looking down.
I&acute;m looking up
at a world I left, I&acute;m looking down.
I&acute;m looking up
at the sky straight ahead,
there&acute;s the moon, the sun&acute;s right behind you;

If you stare it can blind you.
And when you see them both together,
chances are I&acute;m gonna find you looking up.

(Sterling/Kesterson)
"
Rock,"The voices hanging in the air
The fingers running through my hair
You whisper in my ear, words Iâ€™m afraid to hear

You're sleeping on the wings of doves
Of melting in the heat of love
A voice that disappears, into the air

You said you found me, and never let me go, and until you do
No arms around me, to pull me away, away from you

Indian summer, I remember you
Indian summer, do you think of me too?

Like a moth to a flame, youâ€™re drawn to me with tender chains
You wrap me up so tight, and hold me all the night

Whoâ€™s the stranger come and gone, statues crying in the lawn
The fountain's frozen tears, bring back those years

Did you think you loved me, and do you want me now like you did back then
No moon above me, could make me feel this way, feel this way again

Indian summer, I remember you
Indian summer, do you think of me too?

Where do the seasons go when you let them slip away
Now the winds have changed from hot to cold today
Indian summer, Indian summer, I remember you, where are you now

Ohhh, Indian summer, I remember you
Indian summer, do you think of me, do you think of me too
Cause I remember you, Indian summer

"
Rock,"Are you telling me it's over
Disintegrating lost
And there's nothing I can do?
Before you drop another verbal bomb
Can I arm myself with Cezanne's 16 shades of blue?

As my heart is slowly ripping into pieces
Disconnecting from the circuits of my mind
""You'll get over it"", you say ""in time, in time""
If the clocks are black absorbing everything but
A remembering how we made it that
Clocks are black

You say
""Get over it. If 50 is the new black
Hooray! This could be your lucky day""
but my cables they are surging
Almost overloading as you disengage

Could your heart be slowly ripping into pieces
Disconnecting from the circuits of your mind?
""We'll get over it"", you say ""in time, in time""
If the clocks are black absorbing everything but
A remembering how we made it that
Clocks are black

""That's it, you're done!
You've screwed up your life
Before it's begun""
There are those who say
I am now too old to play

See over there at 33 she fears she'll lose her job
Because they hear the ticking of her clock
At only 15 I said 15, they say her future's bleak
She should have started this at 3

As her heart is slowly ripping into pieces
Disconnecting from the circuits of her mind
""She'll get over it"" you say ""in time, in time""
Stop, father
Time
If the clocks are black absorbing everything but
A remembering how we made it that
How our clocks are black

Before you drop another verbal bomb
Can I arm myself with Cezanne's 16 shades of blue?"

Keisha? Amelle?
Oh yeah
Let's go

You messed up from your chromosomes to your enzymes
Remember the time when you took my ride
I had to get it from the impound
My favorite revision
And later when I asked you 'bout it you just said
yeah

But then at least you didn't crash if you had some
cash
Left from selling my rims on the car
Parked behind the bar

And baby that's you on a good day
And baby that's you on a good day
Disaster is always just a beat away
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway

You messed up like when I went to Tokyo
For promotion and got back had a bill for two G's
From when you fell asleep calling me overseas
Asking 'bout my goal for the cash machine and you just
said yeah

But you tried to keep the house key
But then your new party friends went and called for
Some stripper and then I just said (fine)

And baby that's you on a good day
And baby that's you on a good day
Disaster is always just a beat away
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway

And baby that's you on a good day
And baby that's you on a good day
Disaster is always just a beat away
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway

Ladies...
Oooh...
Oooh
Let me get the beat

I want it, I hate it, I need it
I want it, want it, want it
I hate it, I want it, I need it
Yeah, like that
I want it, I hate it, I need it
I want it, want it, want it
I hate it, I want it, I need it

But you tried to keep the house key
But then your new party friends went and called for
Some stripper and then I just said
(You're gonna make it up to me, you know you are)

And baby that's you on a good day
And baby that's you on a good day
Disaster is always just a beat away
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway

And baby that's you on a good day
And baby that's you on a good day
Disaster is always just a beat away
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway

And baby that's you on a good day
And baby that's you on a good day
Disaster is always just a beat away
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway"
Rock,"I told you last night or did you tell me
I think that it was me and I know that you heard it
I was crazy about you that's how it always was
Do you think about me now as I sing about this love

When it rains it pours
When there's no one at the door
Yes he did send me flowers
Well that was a long time ago
Sounded good on a
Delicate white-ribbon card
""One more big time rock and roll star""
Just what I need

As you walk away you know that I will call
If it's just to say goodnight and that is all
Well alright that's a lie she says she wanted you to stay
But you know much better than she
She's better off this way

Undercover music lover
Oh undercover music lover and an art lover like me
There were candles, crystals, I was anyone's fantasy
Say I'm not 'cause the work just gets harder
The work gets...
Oh, one more big time rock and roll star"
Rock,"One, Two, Three, Four

Girl, on the edge flippin' off the lamp
There'll be an end darling to your endless night
On the other side of the street.
Yea, the light on your portrait and the light in your face
And you'll be looking for another pretty place
Baby, this side of the street.

Well, keep dreaming baby that your desire brings and girl
I know the sadness that you find in things, it's true
Well, baby if you can't take the heat, what can I do?

Well, you and your poetry and your boku (?!) world
Behind the face you hide the face of a modern girl
On the other side of the street.
Yea, you've got the look as if you owe the world
Therefore, you go out there and say what you can earn
On the wrong side of the street.

Well, you tire of every day bringing the same and so you
Go out looking for some strange new games
Well, pretty soon you don't know the score anymore.

All right now........... (Guitar Break)

I know the danger that your desire brings
And I know the strangeness that you'll find
Wait and it will seem straighter for you and for me.
Well, turn on the end and baby turn off the lamps
There'll be an end darling to this endless night
On the other side of the street.

Yea, and everyday - well- it just brings the same
You started looking for some very strange new games
On the wrong side of the street.
Well, you and your desires lead to confusion
Well, walk away as I don't follow your illusions
And see, open your eyes and see, girl.

All right..........

Pop,"I know they don't like what we're up to
I'll hold you down you come right now it's all for you
They don't see what we've got like we do
Don't hate it now we run around
They don't have clue
And all I know, when it's time to go
Is that all I need
Is for you to leave with me, leave with me

Want to pick you up
And all night I been waiting
And we hop up in my truck
We roll out and we're racing
Our time really ain't enough
And you know how I'm impatient
Make you feel brand new
Just give me all of you
And I don't know if this is love
But our hearts aint for playing
But I can't get enough
Talking crazy I'm just saying
I just hope it ain't too much
But what we got here is amazing
Make you feel brand new
Just give me all of you

Baby let's just take control tonight
I'm in your zone so take me home
The time is right
All that time of mine that I put in
They ask me why I can't deny
It's all for you

And all I know, when it's time to go
Is that all I need is for you to leave with me, leave with me
Want to pick you up and all night I been waiting
And we hop up in my truck
We roll out and we're racing
Our time really ain't enough
And you know how I'm impatient
Make you feel brand new
Just give me all of you
And I don't know if this is love
But our hearts ain't for playing
But I can't get enough
Talking crazy I'm just saying
I just hope it ain't too much
But what we got here is amazing
Make you feel brand new, just give me all of you
Just give me all of you

Just give me, just give me, just give me all of you
Just give me all of you
Just give me, just give me, just give me all of you"
Rock,"Oh well here she comes now oh I'm on the run now
Pretending just pretending that I don't see her
Just to teach her but darling how much longer
Can I keep on living this lie

She means nothing to me
She means nothing to me
I'm still as free as a bird
Don't care what you heard about me
She means nothing to me no more

Oh she's my world oh not just some girl
Harder it's getting harder to fool anyone
Not just her but I act like a man
She'd expect me to
No tears win her respect
Who am I fooling if I can't fool me
Who believes what their eyes don't see
But I keep on lying

She means nothing to me
She means nothing to me
I'm still as free as a bird
Don't care what you heard about me
She means nothing to me no more

All my dreams are depending on her
And how good I am at pretending that

She means nothing to me
She means nothing to me (haven't you heard)
I'm still as free as a bird
Don't care what you heard about me
She means nothing to me no more

She means nothing to me
She means nothing to me (haven't you heard)
I'm still as free as a bird
Don't care what you heard about me
She means nothing to me no more

She means nothing to me
She means nothing to me (haven't you heard)
I'm still as free as a bird
Don't care what you heard about me
She means nothing to me no more"
Rock,"Pouring in and around the great wellspring
Of simple feeling
And I need bearings in the face of your
Cool cool fire
Walking backwards with the pounding of your voice
Makes my soul tired
And concrete is
As concrete doesn't
And voices can drown

Why should I
Why should I
Why should I
Why should I
Solidify
Make me real
So you can see me

I guess you thought
I'd hide the sun from my liquid thoughts and
Make ice for you
You thought I'd seed my clouds
With the rain of your personal dreams
I guess you thought I'd throw confetti
At your parade of lofty thoughts
I guess you thought I'd shine good morning
In some good morning Jack
Surprise

Why should I
Why should I
Why should I
Why should I
Solidify
Make me real
So you can see me

Pressure, pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure, that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah

That's o-kay
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming 'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow takes me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Doh doh doh bah bah bah bah
O-kay
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
People on streets, people on streets

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about,
Watching some good friends
Screaming 'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow takes me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Turned away from it all, like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love
But it's so slashed and torn
Why why why?
Love love love love

Insanity laughs, under pressure we're cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love, give love

Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care
For the people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure

Pop,"Perfume in my shirt
Puts me in the past
Too lonely to be happy
But too afraid to ask

Here I am again
Stuck in the middle
Here I am again
Stuck in the middle

Too young to settle down
Too old to be in bars
It's hard to take it easy
It's easy to be hard

Here I am again
Stuck in the middle
Here I am again
Stuck in the middle

Forgive me, I am building my ship as it sails
How do I become who I wanna be
While still remaining myself?

People love the old me
I don't know where he's gone
Too tired to be famous
Too vain to be unknown, yeah

Rock,"(Reed)

Ever since I was on cripples Monday,
I've got my eyeballs on my knees.
I rapped for hours with mad Mary Williams,
she said she never understood a word from me
because, I know that she cares about me,
I heard her call my name.

And I know that she's long, dead and gone,
still it ain't the same.
When I wake up in the morning, mama,
I heard her call my name.
I know she's dead and long, gone.
I heard her call my name.
And then I felt my mind split open.

I know that she's long, dead and gone,
still it ain't the same.
When I wake up in the morning, mama,
I heard her call my name.
I know she's dead and long, gone.
Still, I heard her call my name.
And then my mind split open.

Rock,"I hauled myself up out of a ditch
I built me an ark out of gopher wood and pitch
Sat down by the roadside and waited on the rain

Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game

Well I woke last night to the heavy clicking and clack
And a scarecrow on fire along the railroad tracks
There were empty cities and burning plains

Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game

We all come up a little short and we go down hard
These days I spend my time skipping through the dark
Through the empires of dust I chant your name

Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game

Through the bone yard we rattled and black smoke we rolled on
Down into the valley where the beast has his throne
I sing my song and I sharpen my blade

Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game

Strength is vanity and time is illusion
I feel you breathing, the rest is confusion
Your skin touches mine, what else to explain

Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game

Now pray for yourself and that you may not fall
When the hour of deliverance comes on us all
When high hope and faith and courage and trust
Can rise or vanish like dust and dust
Now there's a kingdom of love waiting to be reclaimed

Honey, I'm the hunter of the invisible game
Honey, I'm the hunter of the invisible game
Honey, I'm the hunter of the invisible game"
Rock,"Shooting star
Seems so far
You drink from your jar
I wanna heal my scars

Take care of my child
Take care of my wife
But I'm not so kind
To my restless mind

I wouldn't treat a friend
Like I treat myself
Wouldn't borrow or lend
Run a mile instead

Take care of my child
Take care of my wife
But I'm not so kind
To my restless mind

All the lessons I've learned
All the money I've earned
All the time I've burned
I wasn't in the room

Take care of my child
Take care of my wife
But I'm not so kind
To my restless mind

No, I'm not so kind

Rock,"Your mamma's yappin' in the back seat
Tell her to push over and move them big feet
Every Monday morning I gotta drive her down to the unemployment agency
Well this morning I ain't fighting tell her I give up
Tell her she wins if she'll just shut up
But it's the last time that she's gonna be ridin' with me

(Chorus)
You can tell her there's a hot sun beatin' on the blacktop
She keeps talkin' she'll be walkin' that last block
She can take a subway back to the ghetto tonight
Well I got some beer and the highway's free
And I got you, and baby you've got me.
Hey, hey, hey whataya say Sherry Darlin'

Now there's girls melting on the beach
And they're so fine but so far out of reach
Cause I'm stuck in traffic down here on 53rd street
Now Sherry my love for you is real
But I didn't count on this package deal
And baby this car just aint big enough for her and me

So you can tell her there's a hot sun beatin' on the blacktop
She keeps talkin' she'll be walkin' that last block
She can take a subway back to the ghetto tonight
Well I got some beer and the highway's free
And I got you, and baby you've got me.
Hey, hey, hey whataya say Sherry Darlin'

Well let there be sunlight, let there be rain
Let the brokenhearted love again

To all the girls down at Sacred Heart

Rock,"Here's the town in which I live Petunia Green
Here's the shop and here's the man who sold me laces for my shoes
There is Mr.Marcus. Boys they say he's mad
'Here's the battle that they won' Silver Treetop School For Boys

Early days were good as gold
An apple here an apple there
And everywhere a 'yes sir', 'no sir'
They made me roll the cricket pitch once a day
I've never been so happy than at Silver Treetop School For Boys

The mowing machine was leaving small piles of grass
That when the ??? had risen to the pipe of Mr.Marcus
The smell of teaching fell upon the cricket field
Smiling, laughing, rolling about at Silver Treetop School For Boys.

Hey there
They call in the staff room
They call in the canteen
""Hey come and look at what I found""
""I found some boys and Masters sitting
On the cricket ground at Silver Treetop School For Boys""

The English master, Sir, he wores a purple mask
and the Head, was usually sad, was swinging from a tree
Mr.Brown the Physics man is off his head
And everyone just loves the grass at Silver Treetop School For Boys"
Pop,"Are you happy now?
Are you satisfied with the way
That you let our love die?
So how's it feel to be on the other side
Without me in your life?

I was calling you my world, my heart, my everything

But you didn't give a damn, enough to let me in
But now you know.

If you want to love you've got
To give love or it will disappear
Now you're all alone wishing
You could go back to where
You're happy here
But it's too late to make it right
And you can't take back the byes
No you can't reverse the tears
The truth is hitting you loud and clear
Like oooh oooh
Like oooh oooh.

Stop, baby, let it out
Is there a dark cloud looming
Over you since our breakdown? Has it been difficult?
And are you miserable? Are you missing us now?

Without my love around wishing you could
Turn it around?

Rock,"Well, I shuffled through the city on the 4th of July
I had a firecracker waiting to blow
Breakin' like a rocket who makin' its way
To the cities of Mexico
Lived in an apartment out on Avenue A
I had a tar-hut on the corner of 10th
Had myself a lover who was finer than gold
But I've broken up and busted up since

And love don't play any games with me
Anymore like she did before
The world won't wait, so I better shake
That thing right out there through the door
Hell, I still love you, New York

Found myself a picture that would fit in the folds
Of my wallet and it stayed pretty good
Still amazed I didn't lose it on the roof of the place
When I was drunk and I was thinking of you
Every day the children they were singing their tune
Out on the streets and you could hear from inside
Used to take the subway up to Houston and 3rd
I would wait for you and I'd try to hide

And love won't play any games with you
Anymore if you don't want 'em to
The world won't wait and I watched you shake
But honey, I don't blame you
Hell, I still love you, New York
Hell, I still love you, New York
New York

I remember Christmas in the blistering cold
In a church on the upper west side
Babe, I stood their singing, I was holding your arm
You were holding my trust like a child
Found a lot of trouble out on Avenue B
But I tried to keep the overhead low
Farewell to the city and the love of my life
At least we left before we had to go

And love won't play any games with you
Anymore if you don't want 'em to
So we better shake this old thing out the door
I'll always be thinkin' of you
I'll always love you though New York
I'll always love you though New York, New York, New York

Tell It To Her
Cause I don't want to hear it
Tell It To Her
I know why she would
There's a fool born every minute
When you're in it, it feels so good
Why don't you Tell It To Her

She don't know the darker side of you
She don't know what your love will put her through
Your sweet talkin' makes her feel so safe and sure
But that won't change what you are
And I'm the one who knows it

(Chorus)

Cause I don't want to hear it
Tell It To Her
I know why she would
There's a fool born every minute
When you're in it, it feels so good

You're the one who had it all and wanted more
But you can't do it to me anymore

(Chorus)

Cause I don't want to hear it
Tell It To Her
I don't want to hear it
Tell It To Her
Go on and Tell It To Her
Tell It To Her
There's a fool born every minute
Tell It To Her
Go on and Tell It To Her

And in big wads of money,

And no one will ever
get near me again.
There is safety in numbers,

There are people who watch you
in your windows at night.
And they follow your movements
in the cold fluorescent light.
They wait for their moment,
they'll get you in the end.
There is safety in numbers
in numbers, my friend.

I was just like you before --
You want somebody to love.
Since that day I learned the score --
I know how to rise above.

There is shelter in power
and promises of pain.
And in lovers and lawyers
and dogs pulling at the chain.
And no one will ever
get near me again.
There is safety in numbers,
in numbers, my friend.

You will find me well protected
when you come around today.
So remember what I told you

Down at the bottom
Where everything ends
And the lovers I have lost are gone

I've done enough today
Sweet lord I've done enough today
I've seen the jetsam rise and fall
Singing back to the sands run ashore
Fixed odds and with little care
I shall go into town in the devil's name alone

And the land is dark still

Throw away the nets
And throw away the past
When it's taken you
Half of the day to get over the waves
You carve away"

Well there's a rumble in the park
there's a thunder in the dark
The night's so quiet, it's chain lightning
Beneath a street light two boys bopping in the night
They have something in 'em called chain lightning

Though you never hear a sound
there's a fire underground
Rambling through the town
you can't keep it from coming down
Lovers walking through the mist, Romeo he steal a kiss
Caught up in the moment of chain lightning

Heyy, hey!

Now I don't know about romance
but baby it's the latest thing
Everybody's getting up, doing it, chain lightning
All along the strand baby down in jungleland
Everybody's caught up in chain lightning

Ever hear the sound of a fire underground
Rumbling through the town, the big cold is coming down
Sitting at the light, I'm a rider in the night
Streaking light to light for chain lightning

Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey hey hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Heyy!

I ain't into style, baby, ain't into fashion
I just got a passion for chain lightning
Sitting at the light, I'm a rider in the night
Streaking light to light for chain lightning

Can't remember how you make me sad
Try to make it easy
So I just forget you

And life is making you lonely
You can always go
Down town.

When you've got worries
All the noise and the hurry
Seems to hurt, I know.
Down town.

Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city,
Linger on the sidewalks where the neon signs are pretty.
How can you lose ?

The lights are much brighter there,
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

And go down town.
Things will be great when you're
Down town.
No finer place for sure,
Down town.
Everything's waiting for you.

Don't hang around
And let your problems surround you,
There are movie shows
Down town.

Maybe you know
Some little places to go
To where they never close,
Down town.

Just listen to the rhythm of the gentle bossa-nova,
You'll be dancing with them, too, before the night is over,
Happy again.

The lights are much brighter there,
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

And go down town.
Where all the lights are bright
Down town.
Waiting for you tonight
Down town.
You're gonna be all right now.

And you may find
Somebody kind
To help and understand you,
Someone who is just like you
And needs a gentle hand
To guide him along.

So maybe I'll see you there,
We can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares

And go down town.
Things will be great when you're
Down town.
Don't wait a minute more,
Down town.
Everything's waiting for you."
Rock,"Is it heaven or hell at dawn
You really go it up or your going down
Do you say your prayers late at night
Or do you save them for the desperate times

Do you see the beauty of a rose, I doubt it
Do you hear the children sing aloud, no
Can you see the leaves change the colors out there
Can you taste the water in your mouth

Is it any wonder
Is there any hope
100 Miles Per Hour
Yet the race just still runs slow
The race just still feels slow

Do you believe in good will forever guide
Does your devil take you to your other side
Can karma kill you in your mind

Do you plan to solve this one tonight
Do you see the beauty in a rose, I doubt it
Can you hear the children sing aloud

Is it any wonder
Is there any hope
100 Miles Per Hour
Yet the race just still runs slow
The race just still feels slow

Were running out of time, my friends
Your running out of time, oh yeah, oh yeah

Is there any wonder
Is there any hope

Yet the race just still runs slow
The race just still feels slow
The race just still runs slow
The race just still feels slow"

Give me time, and a little space
If you take me back, where I belong

Lay me down for your inspection

Somehow we'll find away

It's good when I'm bad, I'm sorry to say
When I feel you inside, deep within me

Can't go through this crucifixion
Sacrifice love for affection
There's pain in pleasures resurrection

Sometimes (there's somthin' I need to say)
Sometimes (sometimes)
Treat me kind (Somehow we'll find away)
Keep me safe (I wish this was yesterday)
Show me love (And maybe tomorrow)
Sometimes (I'll remember)

Heedless
Guarded
Makes it hard to understand

With all this history
Trust won't come easily
I know it's hard to believe
Nobody meant you no harm

All the lonely young girls
Caught in a web of confusion
In an unintended world

I wish you could understand

To come to maturity
With some sense of dignity
I know it's hard to believe
Nobody means you no harm

All the lonely old women
All the angry old men
Hoping the hurt was behind them
Starting it over again

Love can be the reality
But only as far as the heart can see

With all this history
Trust won't come easily
I know it's hard to believe
Nobody needs you

To come to maturity
With some sense of dignity
I know it's hard to believe
Nobody means you no harm

Rock,"Seven days and seven nights
Got no sleep on a Greyhound bus, rollin' into town
There's nothing you can recognize, what used to be is now what was
But you know where you're bound

What you know is down the line and what you want you left behind
And all your memories are found when you're rollin' into town

Cornin' back to where you've been gone
Now you know you've been gone too long
You've lost count of the years and what you're runnin' from
But now you know where to go
To the house at the end of the road

So much time, it's hard to heal, so much time, I know you're scared
Rollin' into town
And now it starts to look the same and you wonder what's waiting there
What memories are found when you're rollin' into town

Cornin' back to where you've been gone
Now you know you've been gone too long
You've lost count of the years and what you're runnin' from
But now you know where to go
To the house at the end of the road

What you know is down the line and what you want you left behind
The moment of truth, it all slows down as you're rollin' into town

Cornin' back to where you've been gone
Now you know you've been gone too long
You've lost count of the years and what you're runnin' from
(Now you know where to go)
Cornin' back to where you've been gone
(House at the end of the road)
Now you know you've been gone too long

So I was thinking to myself when you passed me by
""Here's what I like""
And you were with somebody else but you can't deny
That's me in your eye

Do you know
What it's like
When it's wrong
But it feels so right?

Nothing in this world can stop us tonight
I can do what she can do so much better
Nothing in this world can turn out the light
I'm gonna make you feel alright tonight.

Da-da, Da-da, Da-da, Da, Tonight

Baby, you and I, we got what will never be
You know I'm right
So tell me what you're waiting for when you're here with me?
Most guys would die

You should know
What it's like
When it hurts
'Cause it feels so right

No, it's not the same thing

And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there baby I could use just a little help

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Message just keeps getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man I ain't getting nowhere just living
In a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby I just know that there is

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulder
Come on baby the laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all right
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write
This book
I need a love reaction
Come on now baby gimme just one look

You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying
Over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire worrying about
Your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark"

"
Rock,"Raney William's playground was among Haven's streets
Where he ran past melted candles and flower wreaths
Names and photos of the young black faces
Whose death and blood consecrated these places

Raney's mother said Raney stay at my side
For you are my blessing, you are my pride
It's your love here that keeps my soul alive
I want you to come home from school and stay inside

Raney'd do his work and put his books away
There was a channel showed a Western movie everyday
And that brought him home books on the black cowboys of the Oklahoma range
The Seminole scouts that fought the tribes of the Great Plains

Summer come and the days grew long
Raney always had his mother's smile to depend on
Along the street of stray bullets he made his way
To the warmth of her arms at the end of each day

Come the Fall, the rain flooded these homes
In Ezekiel's valley of dry bones
It fell hard and dark to the ground
It fell without a sound

And they took up with a man whose business was the boulevard
Whose smile was fixed in a face that was never off guard
In the pipes 'neath the kitchen sink his secrets are kept
In the day, behind drawn curtains in the next bedroom he slept

And she got lost in the days
The smile Raney depended on dusted away
The arms that held him were no more his own
He lay at night his head pressed to her chest listening to the ghost in her bones

In the kitchen, Raney slipped his hand between the pipes
From a brown bag pulled five hundred dollar bills and stuck it in his coat side
Stood in the dark at his mother's bed
Brushed her hair and kissed her eyes

In the twilight Raney walked to the station on streets of stone
Through Pennsylvania and Ohio his train drifted on
Through the small towns of Indiana the big train crept
As he lay his head back on his seat and slept

He woke and the towns gave way to muddy fields of green
Corn and cotton and endless nothing in between
Over the rutted hills of Oklahoma the red sun slipped and was gone
The moon rose and stripped the earth to its bone"
Rock,"The blood moon shines across the veil
Bells ring out through churches and jails
I tally my wounds and count the scars
Here in the house of a thousand guitars

The criminal clown has stolen the throne
He steals what he can never own
May the truth ring out from every small town bar
We'll light up the house of a thousand guitars

Well it's alright yeah it's alright
Meet me darlin' come Saturday night
All good souls from near and far
Will meet in the house of a thousand guitars

Here the bitter and the bored
Wake in search of the lost chord
That'll band us together for as long as there's stars
Yeah in the house of a thousand guitars

Well it's alright yeah it's alright
Meet me darlin' come Saturday night
Brother and sister wherever you are
We'll meet in the house of a thousand guitars

From the stadiums to the small town bars
We'll light up the house of a thousand guitars

House of a thousand guitars, house of a thousand guitars
Brother and sister wherever you are
We'll rise together till we find the spark
That'll light up the house of a thousand guitars

Well it's alright yeah it's alright

Rock,"Somewhere dark
Before the sun comes up
Where the blinds are closed
And the doors are shut

I reduce you to the rubble in the bottom of my car
Till I cannot tell the poison from the pain

Somewhere, dawn
The stores are closed, out by the beach
I could spray paint your name
No one would see

I reduce you to the poison in the bottom of my car
Till it washes all my worries out to sea

And my demons
That got so bored of dreamin'
My demons
Alcohol and freedom
A King without a Queen
A King without a kingdom

I was so bad on my own
Drawing maps inside my soul to places nobody goes
Woke up confused, just staring at my telephone
Waiting like I'd ever hear your voice again

I feel light, empty, low
Sometimes it is so jagged
I don't know what love is for

Alone like I don't know how to survive
And insane
Till I cannot tell the poison from the pain

I used to think that you were me
Pretending every sentence from your mouth was melody
A tune so turbulent that it cracked open every key
Till everything was broken that I played

Your father stood and cried
On the day your brother married
Someone that he could rely on

No one could heal his heart
Whoever made you cry
So I became the poison and the pain

And my demons
They got so bored of dreamin'
Demons
Alcohol and freedom
A King without a Queen
A King without a kingdom
A King without a Queen
A King without a kingdom"

A place where you exist
Live with your mother' smile
But see you through daddy's eyes

You might lose your dignity
But it's not what it used to be

And don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've loved somebody
Don't say goodbye to the world
Until you've lived like kings and queens
I'll be the first, the last thing that you see
But don't say goodbye to me

Just listen to your heart
Not the voices in your head
Forget how it'd made you feel
But don't forget what was said

Tears are words than we can touch
When words only say so much
Look out what you've got
Then you'll always have enough

You might lose your dignity
But look what its done for me

And don't say goodbye to the world

Who has always been very greedy.
Oh if she does not break her contract!
There's no market for hippos in Philadelphia!

Every single day they weigh her,
Gaining half an ounce means trouble,
They have principles to stand by:
It's a hundred-and-eighteen that were signed for â€”
Only for the weight agreed we pay!
Gaining half an ounce means trouble,
More than that would mean disaster!

But our Anna is not all that stupid
And she knows a contract is a contract
So she'll reason: After all
You still can eat like little Anna
In Louisiana â€” Crabmeat! Porkchops!
Sweet-corn! Chicken!
And those golden biscuits spread with honey!

Think of our house in Louisiana!
Look â€” it's growing! More and more it needs you!
Therefore curb your craving! Gluttons will be punished!

Rock,"What a wonderful hesitation
Who would bear to feel sorry for me
Dropped another pill just to calm me
Collapsed to my knees and fell fast into sleep

There I was drifting
Way out into the sunshine
Expecting to crash but I'm tied to a string
Look at me I'm a tangled puppet
And I might be a mess but I sure can survive

Find myself awake counting sad days
1 2 3 that's too many for me
Dropped another pill just to find me
Reached for my hand but it was already there

Then I started believin'
That I fell out of a tiny raindrop
That lost its way when it decided to roam
Chasing me was a hungry dweller
But I had escaped it by pretending to die

Come follow me, you won't expect the illusion
You'll see, it's my imagination
Hand me your eyes
I will put them in front of mine
You'll see a little better
You'll see a little better

What a wonderful destination
Where I am now, I can no longer see
Dropped another pill just to kill me
Collapsed to my knees and fell fast into sleep

There I was, and there I was, and there I was drifting
Way out into the sunshine
Expecting to crash but I'm tied to a string
Look at me I'm a tangled puppet
I might be a mess but I sure can survive
But I had escaped it by pretending to die"
Rock,"And he says, ""What do you love to do?
Outside your world,
Who spends timewith you?
Whom do you love when you're not working?

Sweet Girl....
Where would you go,
If you had the time?
Crossing some crazy State-line somewhere?
To whom do you cry?
People are unkind,
Sweet Girl...""

But I chose to dance across the stages of the world.
Everyone said I'd never learn...
And I still hear your words, ""Well, I waited all my life for you....Sweet
Girl...""

I did try to come back and listen...
you never knew it...
I didn't wish it...
And I did hear every answer of every question...
It's all about protection....
Still through the sunlighted days I wait...
Track a ghost through the fog....

The sun is burning me...
And you come runnin' out...
In the wind with me...
The ocean is your blanket...
But I chose to dance across the stages of the world...
Everyone said I'd never learn...
I still hear your words, ""Well, I waited all my life for you...
I watched you fly through the world.
In a golden ball...
Many are the cities that I never saw at all...""

Sometimes I feel like I was always on-call
Sometimes even I am allowed to fall...
He says, ""Come down here for a
minute...Well, come down here for a minute....""
He says, ""Come down here for a minute, Sweet Girl...
Sweet Girl..."

It's easier than learnin' your ABCs.

Come on baby, do the Loco-Motion.
A chuga-chuga motion like a railroad train, now.
Come on baby, do the Loco-Motion.
Do it nice and easy now, and don't lose control,
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul,
So, come on, come on, and do The Loco-Motion with me.


Woah ... woah.
Move around the floor in a loco-motion.
Come on baby, do the Loco-Motion.
Do it holdin' hands if'n you get the notion.
Come on baby, do the Loco-Motion.
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do,
It even makes you happy when you're feelin' blue.
So, come on, come on, and do The Loco-Motion with me.
Come on baby, do the Loco-Motion.

Pop,"Beep beep cruise the boys in the ride
Had to stop them don't want to just walk on by
Got me feeling so right
I can stay up all night
Looking sweet, sweet in my candie's today
Ad there's nobody keeping up with my shoe game

Now I'm calling all my girls
Getting ready for the turn up
Sing it, fifth harmony

All my ladies stand up
All my ladies stand up
Rock your candie's
All my ladies stand up
All my ladies stand up
In your candie's
All my ladies stand up
All my ladies stand up
And rock your candie's
All my ladies stand up
All my ladies stand up

If I like it then I gotta get another
You girls got it in every color
Got the dress, purse, craft skirts
Got on the whole crew on flick
I keep the new cute tops, tight jean
But I'm a candie's pump girl low key
If I tell you that I'm shopping
You know where to come find me

All my ladies stand up
All my ladies stand up
Rock your candie's
All my ladies stand up

Rock,"If there is something
That I might find
Look around corners
Try to find peace of mind, I say
""Where would you go
If you were me?
Trying to keep a straight course is not easy""

Somebody special
Looking at me
Same kind of reaction
Wanted to crie with me
Lived here and there
It's too easy to say
But the service just a game a game-ame-ame-ame

I would do anything for you
I would come all day
I would swim all the oceans blue hu
I would walk a thousand miles
Reveal my secrets
More than enough for me to share
I will put roses around the door
Sit in the garden
Growing potatoes by the score

Shake your head girl, with your ponytail
Takes me right back [when you were young]
Throw your precious gifts into the air
Watch them fall down [when you were young]

Your love - feel you put them on the ground
It use to fall apart [when you were young]

Your love - feel you put them on the ground
The hills were higher [when you were young]

Your love - feel you put them on the ground
The trees were taller then [when you were young]

Your love - feel you put them on the ground
The grass was greener [when you were young]

Your love could feel you with devotion

Rock,"A mother dies, leaving her young son to come to terms with the loss. In remembrance of Fiona Chappel, for her sons Tyler and Oliver.

I was barely 13 years old
She came out of the Guadalupe's on a night so cold
Her coat was frosted diamonds in the sallow moon's glow
My silver palomino
Sixteen hands from her withers to the ground
I lie in bed and listen to the sound
Of the west Texas thunder roll
My silver palomino
I track her into the mountains she loved
Watch her from the rocks above
She'd dip her neck and drink from the winter flows
My silver palomino
Our mustaneros were the very best, sir
But they could never lay a rope on her
No corral will ever hold
The silver palomino
In my dreams bareback I ride
Over the pradera low and wide
As the wind sweeps out the draw
'Cross the scrub desert floor
I'd give my riata and spurs
If I could be forever yours
I'd ride into the serrania where no one goes
For my silver palomino
Summer drought come hard that year
Our herd grazed the land so bare
Me and my dad had to blowtorch the thorns off the prickly pear
And mother, your hand slipped from my hair
Tonight I wake early the sky is pearl, the stars aglow
I saddle up my red roan
I ride deep into the mountains along a ridge of pale stone
Where the air is still with the coming snow
As I rise higher I can smell your hair
The scent of your skin, mother, fills the air
'Midst the harsh scrub pine that grows
I watch the silver palomino

Mustaneros: Mustangers
Pradera: Prairie
Riata: Rope
Serrania: Sierra
Prickly Pear: Cactus"
Pop,"I got flaws I can't disguise
I've been running from them all my life
On the surface I'm all smiles
But I'm only living half a lie

Stuck behind the glass
And the walls are closing in
Stuck inside a past that won't let me leave
But I'm in chains while you're breaking free

Stuck behind the glass
And I'm waiting for your call
Nothing ever lasts for a prisoner
And I'm in chains while you're breaking free
And it's killing me

I got flaws I can't disguise
And you tried to pull me to the light
I can't go back and make it right
And I wonder where you sleep tonight

Stuck behind the glass
And the walls are closing in
Stuck inside a past that won't let me leave
But I'm in chains while you're breaking free

Stuck behind the glass
And I'm waiting for your call
Nothing ever lasts for a prisoner
And I'm in chains while you're breaking free
And it's killing me

We were never born to make it out of this alive
And we were never born
To make it how could we survive

Stuck behind the glass
And the walls are closing in
Stuck inside a past that won't let me leave
And I'm in chains while you're breaking free

Stuck behind the glass
And I'm waiting for your call
Nothing ever lasts for a prisoner
And I'm in chains while you're breaking free
And it's killing me"
Rock,"Think about the good things
Think about the bad things
Think about a reason to see you tonight
Something getting hard when you rock it up
Something getting hot when you rock it up
Pretty little girl let your sweet thing sway
Never gonna treat you wrong
Tie you down pretend you're Madonna
Never gonna treat you wrong

Oh you pretty thing
Shake your pretty thing
Gimmee that pretty thing

Think about the love thing
Think about the sex thing
Think about you holding me, taking me down
Something getting hard when you rock it up
Something getting hot when you rock it up
Pretty little girl let your sweet thing sway
Never gonna do you wrong
Strip you down and take you to pieces
Always gonna love this song

Oh you pretty thing
Feel that pretty thing
Suck that pretty thing

Pretty pretty pretty girl
La la la la la la la
Hey hey
Gimmie love
Pretty girl
Oh you pretty thing
Shake that pretty thing
Give me that pretty thing
Oh pretty thing
Give me that pretty thing
Shake that pretty thing
Give me that pretty thing
Oh you pretty thing
Shake that pretty thing
Heal that pretty thing

Rock,"All your two-bit psychiatrists
are giving you electroshock
They said, they'd let you live at home with mom and dad
instead of mental hospitals
But every time you tried to read a book
you couldn't get to page 17
'Cause you forgot where you were
so you couldn't even read

Don't you know they're gonna kill your sons
don't you know gonna kill, kill your sons
They're gonna kill, kill your sons
until they run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run away

Mom informed me on the phone
she didn't know what to do about dad
Took an axe and broke the table
aren't you glad you're married
And sister, she got married on the island
and her husband takes the train
He's big and he's fat
and he doesn't even have a brain

They're gonna kill your sons
don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
Don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
until they run away

Creedmore treated me very good
but Paine Whitney was even better
And when I flipped out on PHC
I was so sad, I didn't even get a letter
All of the drugs, that we took
it really was lots of fun
But when they shoot you up with thorizene on crystal smoke
you choke like a son of a gun

Don't you know they're gonna kill your sons
don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
Don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
until they run, run, run, run, run, run, run away

Rock,"Take a look
At what I got
I can't promise you a lot

But you and me
And the road ahead

I can't change
You from yourself
You gotta want it
All that's left

Is you and me
And the road ahead

Wherever that wind might blow
Wherever that river rolls
You know I will go with you

Lookin' over
The mountain's crown
The water roars
And tumbles down

Like you and me
And the road ahead

Wherever that wind might blow
Wherever that river rolls
You know I will go with you

Just you and me
And the road ahead

Just you and me
And the road ahead"

Rock,"BABY DOLL

Oh Baby Doll
They tried to tell me you were deaf and dumb
But I knew they were wrong
You're just a silent one

Oh Baby Doll
They tried to tell me you could not feel
But I found out they tried to conceal
From you, that you were a woman

Well they brought you into their laboratory
And tried to get you to show and tell
They wanted to hear you say that you were sorry
And then they told you that you were conceived in hell

But Baby Doll, you knew
you knew that wasn't true
you knew that it was them
it wasn't you

Oh baby doll
It was so hard to know you
I could not tell, I couldn't show you
But I didn't have to, 'cause you already knew

Oh baby doll
They had to see by touching hands
We had to dance to a silent band
and you surprised me, being so graceful

I know you can't hear these songs I sing
But then they're more for me than they are for you
Because you don't need these songs, babe, like I do
Yeah, you knew the first time that I held you babe
You didn't have to hear how I love

Oh baby doll
They tried to tell me you were deaf and dumb
But I knew that they were wrong
And you were just the lonely one

Rock,"What is this land of America, so many travel there
I'm going now while I'm still young, my darling meet me there
Wish me luck my lovely, I'll send for you when I can
And we'll make our home in the American land

Over there all the woman wear silk and satin to their knees*
And children dear, the sweets, I hear, are growing on the trees*
Gold comes rushing out the river straight into your hands*
If you make your home in the American land*

There's diamonds in the sidewalks, there's gutters lined in song
Dear I hear that beer flows through the faucets all night long
There's treasure for the taking, for any hard working man
Who will make his home in the American land

I docked at Ellis Island in a city of light and spire
I wandered to the valley of red-hot steel and fire****
We made the steel that built the cities with the sweat of our two hands
And I made my home in the American land

There's diamonds in the sidewalk, there's gutters lined in song
Dear I hear that beer flows through the faucets all night long
There's treasure for the taking, for any hard working man
Who will make his home in the American land

The McNicholas, the Posalski's, the Smiths, Zerillis too**
The Blacks, the Irish, the Italians, the Germans and the Jews
The Puerto Ricans, illegals, the Asians, Arabs miles from home***-*****
Come across the water with a fire down below******

They died building the railroads, worked to bones and skin
They died in the fields and factories, names scattered in the wind
They died to get here a hundred years ago, they're dyin' now
The hands that built the country we're all trying to keep down

There's diamonds in the sidewalk, there's gutters lined in song
Dear I hear that beer flows through the faucets all night long
There's treasure for the taking, for any hard working man
Who will make his home in the American land
Who will make his home in the American land
Who will make his home in the American land"

Candy says: I've come to hate my body
And all that it requires in this world
Candy says: I'd like to know completely
What others so discreetly, talk about.

Candy says: I hate the quiet places
That cause the smallest taste of what will be
Candy says: I hate the big decisions
That cause endless revisions in my mind.

I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly over my shoulder
I'm gonna watch them pass me by
Maybe when I'm older;
What do you think I'd see,
If I could walk away from me."
Pop,"Seven hours since you went away
Eleven coffees, Rickki Lake on play
But late at night when I'm feeling blue
I'd sell my ass before I think of you

Seven hours since you closed the door
Started a diet, got a manicure
Erased your number from my telephone
And if you call me I won't be at home

Eleven hours on a brand new day
I'm getting ready to go out and play
It's late at night, I'm caught in a groove
I'd kiss my ass before I'm feeling blue

Seven hours, what you calling for?
A bunch of flowers and I slam the door
You're in my face, sorry what's your name?
Takes more than begging to reverse my brain

Doesn't mean I'll put up with you

Pop,"Make me fumble
Make me fall
Make my heart stop and start
To tremble uncontrollably
Let my eyes see fear make desire
Keep those who long apart
Forbid the kiss
And leave us innocent
Of the things some do in the dark

The things some do in the dark
The things some do in the dark

Make me remember
Make me forget
Make my mind unable
To force the body to do its will
Let it be right for belief and denial
To share a space in the heart and leave us only to imagine
About the things some do in the dark

The things some do in the dark
The things some do in the dark

Make me pretend
Make me expect
Things can go and come to pass
Without trial or tribulation
Let this life space and time
Leave my body with permanent marks
Faded scars and lines
But not a single impression
Of the things some do in the dark

The things some do in the dark
The things some do in the dark

Let me be tempted
Let me be torn
But make my thoughts pure and not
Morally corrupt in form
Let us sleep tonight
Let innocence lie in our dreams and secret hearts
With burning desire
A need to know and do
The things some do in the dark

The things some do in the dark
The things some do in the dark

The things some do in the dark
The things some do in the dark"

I'm at your door I'm at your door I'm at your door

You better know you better know you better know
I'm at your door I'm at your door I'm at your door"
Rock,"She says, What do you call love
well I call it Harry
Oh, please I'm being serious
what do you call love

Well I don't call it family and I don't call it lust
and as we all know marriage isn't a must
And I suppose in the end, it's a matter of trust
if I had to I'd call love time

She says, What do you call love
can't you be more specific
What do you call love
is it more than the heart's hieroglyphic

Well for me time has no meaning, no future, no past
and when you're in love, you don't have to ask
There's never enough time to hold love in your grasp
turning time around

Turning time around
that is what love is
Turning time around
yes, that is what love is

My time is your time when you're in love
and time is what you never have enough of
You can't see or hold it, it's exactly like love

Turning time around
turning time around
Turning time around
turning time around
Turning time around
well I gotta have it
I gotta-gotta-gotta have it

Turning, turning time around
gotta have it, turning time around
Turning, turning time around
turning time around
"
Rock,"I like small speakers-I like tall speakers
If they've music-they've wired for sound

Walkin' about with a head full of music
Casette in my pocket and I'm gonna use it-stereo
-out on the street you know-woh oh woh...

Into the car go to work I'm cruisin'
I never think that I'll blow all my fuses
Traffic flows-into the breakfast show-woh oh woh...

Power from the needle to the plastic
A.m.-F.m. I feel so ecstatic now
It's music I've found
And I'm wired for sound

I was small boy who don't like his toys
I could not wait to get wired for sound

I met a girl and she told me she loved me
I said you love me then love means you must like what I like-
My music is dynamite-woh oh woh...

She said-I'm not a girl you put on at a stand by
I am a girl who demands that her love is amplified
Switch in to overdrive-woh oh woh

Power from the needle to the plastic
A.m.-F.m. I feel so ecstatic now
It's music I've found
And I'm wired for sound"
Rock,"Way to go Mr.Microphone
Show us all what you don't know
Centuries, secret societes
He's our commander still
Space dog

So sure we were onto something
Your feet are finally on the ground he said
So sure we were onto something
Your feet are just on the ground girl

Rain and snow our engine's down
Been receiving your eager call
There's Colonel Dirtyfishy discloth
He'll distract her good don't worry so

And to the one you thought was on your side
She can't understand, she truly believes the lie

Lemon Pie he's coming through
Our commander still Space dog

Deck the halls I'm young again, I'm new again
Racing turtles the grapefruit is winning
Seems I keep getting this story twisted
So were's Neil when you need him
Deck the halls it's you again it's you again s
Somewhere someone must know the ending
Is she still pissing in the river now
Heard she'd gone moved into a trailer park

So sure we were onto something
Your feet are finally on the ground he said
So sure we were onto something
Your feet are just on the ground girl

(So sure those girls are in the Navy
Those bombs our friends can't even hurt you now and
You hold these tears
'Cause they're still on your side
Don't hear the dogs barking
Don't say you know we've gone
Andromeda stood with those girls
before the hair in pairs it just got nasty
and now those girls are gone)
"
Rock,"Black girl, black girl, don't you lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night ?
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun never shines
And I shivered the whole night long.

Tell me where did you get that pretty little dress
And those shoes that you wear so fine ?
I got my dress from a railroad man
And my shoes from a driver deep in the mine.

Black girl, black girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night ?
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun never shines
"
Pop,"In the shadows, you've got to know your lover mostly by feel
You've got to put your faith in things you can touch
If you dare to

Cos the shadows, can make you crazy with the things they reveal
They show it all without revealing too much
Scare the hell out of you

Chorus
Cos me and my love, live among the shadows
Where the old playground is an alley way
Now me and my love, make love among the shadows
When the sun goes down, in a dark hallway
Love in the shadows where the crowd never goes
Deep in the shadows where flowers won't grow
Me and my baby know, love in the shadows

In the shadows, you've got to work at love to get it to shine
You can't believe in everything that you see
Not this time around

Cos the shadows, can play a half a million tricks on your mind
You try your best but you can never be free
It just kinda drags you down

Cos me and my love, live among the shadows
Where the old playground is an alley way
Now me and my love, make love among the shadows
When the sun goes down, in a dark hallway
Love in the shadows where the crowd never goes
Deep in the shadows where flowers won't grow
Me and my baby know, love in the shadows

Rock,"Those boon times went bust
My feet of clay, they dried to dust
The red isn't the red we painted
Its just rust
And the signature thing
That used to bring a following
I have trouble now
Even remembering

So why did I kiss him so hard
Late last Friday night
And keep on letting him change all my plans
I'm either so sick in the head
I need to be bled dry, to quit
Or I just really used to love him
I sure hope thats it

I knew that to keep in touch
Would do me deep in dutch
Cuz it isn't the rush of remembering
Its just mush
And the signature thing
Is only growing harrowing
I should have no trouble now
To keep from following

So why did I kiss him so hard
Late last Friday night
And keep on letting him change all my plans
I'm either so sick in the head
I need to be bled dry, to quit
Or I just really used to love him
I sure hope thats it

Rock,"Want some whiskey in your water?
Sugar in your tea?
What's all these crazy questions they're askin' me?
This is the craziest party that could ever be
Don't turn on the lights 'cause I don't wanna see

Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
That ain't the way to have fun, no

Open up the window, let some air into this room
I think I'm almost chokin' from the smell of stale perfume
And that cigarette you're smokin' 'bout scare me half to death
Open up the window, sucker, let me catch my breath

Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
That ain't the way to have fun, son

The radio is blastin', someone's knockin' at the door
I'm lookin' at my girlfriend - she's passed out on the floor
I seen so many things I ain't never seen before
Don't know what it is - I don't wanna see no more

Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
She said, that ain't the way to have fun, son"

Now this is the part that my daddy told me
He got me feelin' like

Pop,"Well, I found him in Pensacola
In a trailer in the sand
The man from the picture
Creased and yellowed in my hand
Creased and yellowed in my hand

He was squinting and stubbled
And standing in the door
He said, if you've come to take the car away
I don't have it anymore
I don't have it anymore

He got the gospel on the radio
And the gospel on tv
He got all of the transcripts
Back to 1963
Back to 1963

He said I sold my blood for money
There wasn't any pain
But I just can't stand the feeling
It's in someone else's veins
It's in someone else's veins

Momma took me aside
And she tried to change my mind
She said, don't waste your time in looking
There's nothing, nothing left to find
Nothing, nothing left to find

So I left him down in Pensacola
In a trailer in the sand
The man from the picture
Creased and yellowed in my hand
Creased and yellowed in my hand

"
Rock,"Baby, why do they say the things they say
Would it be easier to live the way they say we should
Maybe, cannot but wonder back this way
Yours are the only arms that make me feel like something can be good

I believe itâ€™s just a fact of life
Unless they wear our shoes to them itâ€™s black and white

Ooohhhh

Just what does it matter anyway
What side of the road weâ€™re standing on
And just what does it matter anyway
If in the long run nothing changes after we are gone
If nothing changes after we are gone

Baby, donâ€™t let them rob you of your pride
Thereâ€™s not a thing I wouldnâ€™t do to make this easier for you
Maybe, every now and then I laugh and cry
Itâ€™s getting harder now for me to separate the two

Where does innocence turn in to make believe
Cause make believe thereâ€™s no one here but me and you

Ohhh

Just what does it matter anyway
What side of the road weâ€™re standing on
And just what does it matter anyway
If you throw my love away because the world donâ€™t think itâ€™s right
And they may never understand
And you can't change the minds of those who are blind
Unless you give them sight
And the world lies in your hand

Tell me, and just what does it matter anyway
If in the long run nothing changes after we are gone
If nothing changes after we are gone

"
Rock,"When we fight and I wanna talk it out
You won't say nothing, nothing at all
You just sit there, you won't open that pretty mouth
I think you like keeping my back up against the wall
Wages of sin, you keep me paying
Wages of sin for wrongs that I've done
Wages of sin, you keep me paying
Wages of sin, one by one

I walk in the apartment, there's clothes thrown all over the place
You're crouched in the corner with makeup running down your face
I don't wanna believe what my heart keeps saying
You keep me on the line so you can keep me paying
Wages of sin, we keep paying
Wages of sin for the wrongs that we've done
Wages of sin, we keep paying
Wages of sin, that's how we have our fun

I remember when I was a little boy out where the cottonwoods grow tall
Trying to make it home through the forest before the darkness falls
Baby all the sounds I heard, even if they weren't real
I was running down that broken path with the devil snapping at my heels
I tried so hard, so hard in every way
Swore someday I'd grow up, just throw it all away
Cried all the tears, baby, that I could cry
Stomached all my fears till they came rushin' up inside
Darlin' I'm losin' and it's a mean game
Still I play on and on just the same
Wages of sin, I keep paying
Wages of sin for some wrong that I've done
Wages of sin, well I keep paying
Wages of sin, one by one

You're not ready now
Slow down

I know you thinking that you're ready, ready, ready (ready)
But just remember that you're still a young lady
Cause you got nothing but time on your side
Girl, you got the rest of your life

But this is something that I just gotta do
(And I hope I can change your mind)
Oh yeah, cause you've got nothing but time

You better slow it down cause you're not ready now (you're not ready now)
You better slow it down cause you're not ready now

No, you're not ready now, you better slow it down
No, you're not ready now, you better slow it down

I know what's on your mind you better (think about it, think about it)
You know it just ain't right you better (think about it, think about it)
Going through your life you better (think about it, think about it)
Before you pay the price, you better think twice

You better slow down
You better slow down, you're not ready now
You better slow down
You better slowdown, you're not ready now
You better slow down"
Rock,"It seems the songs we're singing
Are all about tomorrow,
Tunes of promises that we can't keep.
Every moment bringing
A love I can only borrow,
You're telling me lies in your sleep.

Do you think I'm not aware
Of what you're saying
Or why you're saying it ?
Is it hard to keep me where
You want me staying ?
Don't go on betraying.

Don't make promises that you can't keep.

We had a chance to find it,
Our time was now or never,
You promised me things that I need.
And then the things behind it
Took away the chance forever,
You're telling me lies in your sleep.

Do you think I'm not aware
Of what you're saying
Or why you're saying it ?
Is it hard to keep me where
You want me staying ?
Don't go on betraying.

Don't make promises that you can't keep.
Don't make promises that you can't keep.
Don't make promises that you can't keep.

Rock,"Oh, Lady Madeleine,
I miss you baby, I can't stand the pain.
And I walk down the avenue
And I think of you, Lady Madeleine.

And MichÃ¨le, what will she do
Without you, Lady Madeleine ?
And I walk down the avenue
And I'm missing you, Lady Madeleine.

And Spanish Tony don't know what to do,
He's missing you, darling Madeleine.
His strange world has all fallen through
And he wonders, was his love in vain ?

And I think I might go quite insane
With the scenes here Lady Madeleine.
So I walk down the avenue
And I miss you, Lady Madeleine.

And Spanish Tony, he don't know what to do,
He's missing you, darling Madeleine.
His strange world has all fallen through
And he wonders, was his love in vain ?

And I think I might go quite insane
With the scenes here darling Madeleine.
So I walk down the avenue
And I miss you Lady Madeleine.

Yes, I walk down the avenue
And I think of you Lady Madeleine.
Yes, I walk down the avenue
And I miss you Lady Madeleine.

Oh, I walk down the avenue
And I think of you, darling Madeleine.
Oh, I walk down the avenue
"
Rock,"Well I sought gold and diamond rings
My own drug to ease the pain that living brings
Walked from the mountain to the valley floor
Searching for my beautiful reward
Searching for my beautiful reward

From a house on a hill a sacred light shines
I walk through these rooms but none of them are mine
Down empty hallways I went from door to door
Searching for my beautiful reward
Searching for my beautiful reward

Well your hair shone in the sun
I was so high I was the lucky one
Then I came crashing down like a drunk on a barroom floor
Searching for my beautiful reward
Searching for my beautiful reward

Tonight I can feel the cold wind at my back
I'm flyin' high over gray fields my feathers long and black
Down along the river's silent edge I soar
Searching for my beautiful reward
Searching for my beautiful reward
"
Rock,"Well, the river runs through this valley
Combing deep and black [?]
Coming like a tombstone's
Shadows across my back

Trouble River
Six foot high and risin'
Trouble River
I can't keep from cryin'

Woke up last night a'shakin'
Shakin' from a dream
All I seen was smilin' faces
Starin' back at me

Trouble River
Six foot high and risin'
Trouble River
I can't keep from cryin'

Snakes crawling in the house
I'm stuck in muddy ground
Tonight I'm gonna shed this skin
Cause water's risin' and I goin' down to
Trouble River
Six foot high and risin'
Trouble River
I can't keep from cryin'

Pop,"Life is moving faster
But I’m taking my time
I’m gonna be there when I get there
You just follow the signs
I’m making something out of nothing
And if you want a ride

Get yourself together and we’ll leave the world behind

Get up
Get on my cloud
Lift your feet right off the ground
Nothing gonna stand in our way
(Oooh)
Get up
Get on my cloud
I’m not gonna let you down
Let’s make it happen today

I’ve been busy doing nothing
And it’s starting to show
But let’s turn nothing into something
I can’t do it alone

Lift your feet right off the ground
Nothing gonna stand in our way

Lift your feet right off the ground
Nothing gonna stand in our way

Rock,"Look as wild as hell
You think you're dead now
But just open your eyes
I feel my skin burning with the fear
Just because I get around
With naked hands
I run, voices roar

Know how...

Slices of vices
High pitched heads
Water after spices
The steaks and the forbidden breads
Slices of days
Best moments like highways
Amnesia for the worst moments
The same for tomorrow presents

My beats ex-machina(e)
My beats are not fugazi
My beats weren't made in China

Know how...

Look as wild as hell
You think you're dead now
But just open your eyes
I feel my skin burning with the fear
Just because I get around
With naked hands
I run, voices roar

Know how...

My woman gives me a Tupperware
To take my thinkings and things to everywhere

Know how...

Forbidden places
Forbidden ears
Forbidden eyes
Forbidden ages"
Rock,"Come on now, give me some sugar
Give me some sugar, little honey bee
Don't be afraid, not gonna hurt you
I wouldn't hurt my little honey bee

Don't say a word, 'bout what we're doin'
Don't say nothin' little honey bee
Don't tell your momma, don't tell your sister
Don't tell your boyfriend, little honey bee

She like to call me king bee
She like to buzz 'round my tree
I call her honey bee
I'm a man in a trance
I'm a boy in short pants
When I see my honey bee
And I've got something to say

Look here now, peace in the valley
Peace in the valley with my honey bee
Don't say a word, 'bout what we're doin'
Don't say nothin' little honey bee

She give me her monkey hand
And a Rambler sedan
I'm the king of Milwaukee
Her juju beads are so nice
She kissed my third cousin twice
I'm the king of Pomona
And I've got something to say"
Rock,"Hey Mrs. C, please don't jump why not?
Nothing is making sense anymore to me
I don't know when I stopped making him smile
Now the kids see me crying all the time

From one mother to the other
They'll never get over this for their lifetime
All their wishes will be dashed upon those cliffs
so let's be strong for you and
me the night is opening
Our angels are falling and they will warm us
She asked right now right here
I'm feeling so (mad dear)

Maybe California
Maybe California

As mothers we have our troubles
you'll leave them with emptiness for their lifetime
All their wishes will be dashed upon those cliffs
So let?s be strong you and me the night is opening
Our angels are falling and they will warm us
She asked right now right here
I'm feeling so (mad dear)

Maybe California
Maybe California

Until then there will be starlight shining down
For every tear and every child

I know what i'm all about, nobody's gonna change me,
I stand my ground and deal with negativity,
I got my mind made up,
I'm gonna do whatever makes me happy,
One step at a time, I chose my own destiny.

[Bridge:]
There's no doubt, what it's all about
My dreams are coming true,
Won't stop can't stop,
DO what i need to do,

[Chorus:]
I can stand upon my own,
No one can bring me down down,
I know i'm gonna shine shine, shine shine
I will hold my head up high,
I'm gonna make it through, through
Because it's my time to shine shine, Shine shine.

[Verse:]
I don't let things get to me,
I wanna live stress free,
No one, and nothing gonna get the best of me,
Believe in myself no matter how hard things may seem,

Keep climbing to the top,
My dreams will be in reach, (Ohhh)

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I'll never lose sign of what i want in my life,
I'll stay true to myself,
No one can tell me, what the future holds,
I'll stay strong no matter,
I will survive, I'm gonna shine.

(c'mon, yeah, uh, [Repeat])

[Chorus]

[REWIND]

[Chorus]

I can stand upon my own,
No one can bring me down down,
I know i'm gonna shine shine, shine shine

Rock,"I met a girl and we ran away
I swore I'd make her happy every day
And how I made her cry
Two faces have I

Sometimes mister I feel sunny and wild
Lord I love to see my baby smile
Then dark clouds come rolling by
Two faces have I

One that laughs one that cries
One says hello one says goodbye
One does things I don't understand
Makes me feel like half a man

At night I get down on my knees and pray
Our love will make that other man go away
But he'll never say goodbye
Two faces have I

Last night as I kissed you 'neath the willow tree
He swore he'd take your love away from me
He said our life was just a lie
And two faces have I
Well go ahead and let him try
"
Pop,"Why ?
Why do the babies starve
When there's enough food to feed the world
Why when there're so many of us
Are there people still alone
Why are the missiles called peace keepers
When they're aimed to kill
Why is a woman still not safe
When she's in her home
Love is hate
War is peace
No is yes
And we're all free
But somebody's gonna have to answer
The time is coming soon
Admidst all these questions and contradictions
There're some who seek the truth
But somebody's gonna have to answer
The time is coming soon
When the blind remove their blinders
And the speechless speak the truth

"
Rock,"CHORUS
Walk like a man, and talk like a man.
Walk like a man, hey baby, you can call me your man.


A little girl asked me what am I gonna' do,
When I get old and blue and worn clear through?
And I say by that time I ought to be in my prime,
I'm gonna' strut like a cock until I'm ninety-nine.


I'm gonna' ...
CHORUS


Sometimes I feel it's gettin' late.
In life -- all that settlin' down can wait,
'Till my routine days all seem the same.
Right now, I've got to get on out, I've got to make my day.


I'm gonna' ...

Don't let us get sick
Don't let us get old
Don't let us get stupid, all right?
Just make us be brave
And make us play nice
And let us be together tonight

The sky was on fire
When I walked to the mill
To take up the slack in the line
I thought of my friends
And the troubles they've had
To keep me from thinking of mine

Don't let us get sick
Don't let us get old
Don't let us get stupid, all right?
Just make us be brave
And make us play nice
And let us be together tonight

The moon has a face
And it smiles on the lake
And causes the ripples in Time
I'm lucky to be here
With someone I like
Who maketh my spirit to shine

Don't let us get sick
Don't let us get old
Don't let us get stupid, all right?
Just make us be brave
And make us play nice
And let us be together tonight

Pop,"Come on, come on
I'm right, I'm wrong and when I'm wrong I say
We always had the good and bad
And that will never change
This is the closest, I've ever been
Oohh yeah

We give, we take
We mend, we break
And so the cycle goes
We're doing well, we've been through hell
And only heaven knows
How far we get to
Thank God I met you though
And if you don't know

Just put your hand on my heart
Put your hand on my heart
And I don't have to say it
And I don't have to think it
Just put your hand on my heart
Just put your hand on my heart
You'd know

Come on, come on
'Cause you're the one that I want for myself
The strength you give I wanna live
Inside our little shell
Nothing comes close to
Nothings supposed to yeah
You have your doubts the same way I do
When you're wrapped safe in my love
That's the truth

Just put your hand on my heart
Put your hand on my heart
And I don't have to say it
And I don't have to think it
Just put your hand on my heart
Just put your hand on my heart
You'd know

When you don't feel
That you're strong enough to make it
When life treats you hard
And don't think you can take it
When you don't where you stand
You're close to breaking
Just put your hand on my heart
Put your hand on my heart

Just put your hand on my heart
Put your hand on my heart
And I don't have to say it
And I don't have to think it
Just put your hand on my heart
Just put your hand on my heart
You'd know

Just put your hand on my heart
Put your hand on my heart
And I don't have to say it
And I don't have to think it
Just put your hand on my heart
Just put your hand on my heart
You'd know"
Pop,"Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.

You said you'd never ever try to break my heart,
You told a lie, you tore my love apart.
You said you always wanted someone just like me,
You let me down, baby you set me free.
Whether it's wrong or whether it's right,
Won't take me through the night.
You told me that you loved me so,
And you'd never let me go.
You played the game you're not the same,
I never thought you'd ever change,
But if it's got to be this way,
I'm never gonna fall in love!

Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.
Break One

When I heard this crazy stuff about this other guy,
I didn't believe it had to see it with my eyes.
When I saw you and him, you passed me by,
He's not your friend, he's the other guy.
Whether it's wrong or whether it's right,
Won't take me through the night.
You told me that you loved me so,
And you'd never let me go.
You played the game you're not the same,
I never thought you'd ever change.
But if it's got to be this way,
I'm never gonna fall on love!

Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.
Break Two

I'm never gonna fall, 'cause I fell,
Lovin' you for me was like hell.
How could you play me like a champ,
A tramp, a cramp?
Girl you did me worse than a food stamp.
You told me I could trust you,
If I didn't I would crush you.
Never thought that one day I'd bust you,
Walkin' in the sand hand and hand with another man.
I know your game plan and now I understand.
Love is so deep, it's like sleep,
It will leave you blind.
I see how you're livin' so baby next time,
Whatcha gonna do now that the table's are truned around?
I'm livin' swell and now you wanna be down?
Step off, 'cause baby I've learned,
If you're messin' with fire then you're gonna get burned.
You still look dope but a dope I'm not,
I can't get with you 'cause you're too hot.
Whether it's wrong or whether it's right,
Won't take me through the night.
You told me that you loved me so,
And you'd never let me go.
You played the game you're not the same,
I never thought you'd ever change.
But if it's got to be this way,
I'm never gonna fall on love!

Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.

Never gonna fall,
I'm never gonna fall,
never, never, never

Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.

Pop,"There's a line and it's hard to cross
Scared to say the things that we both feel
But all my life I have been so lost
Running from every heart that's real

Now I wanna see the lights
And I wanna see it all
I'm ready for the rise even if we fall
I don't wanna be alone
Wanna wake and see the sun
Darling it has only just begun
And I'll sing it

Shout it out, sing it loud, I've got something to say
You're the one that I want and I'm screaming your name
Can I kiss you? 'Cause the night is closing in
Oh I, oh I, I'm ready for it
I come alive, I feel alive when you walk my way
There's a room in my heart, do you wanna stay?
And I'll show you that you're all I'm thinking of
Oh I, oh I, I'm ready for love

The doubts you have make you insecure
But I don't mind if you feel unsure
I've heard you say, thinking we've been here before
But close your eyes, and think of it no more

Do you wanna see the lights
Do you wanna see it all
Are you ready for the rise even if we fall
I don't wanna be alone
Wanna wake and see the sun
Cause darling we have only just begun
And I'll sing it

Shout it out, sing it loud, I've got something to say
You're the one that I want and I'm screaming your name
Can I kiss you cause the night is closing in
Oh I, oh I, I'm ready for it
I come alive, I feel alive when you walk my way
There's a room in my heart, do you wanna stay
And I'll show you that you're all I'm thinking of
Oh I, oh I, I'm ready for love

And I know what we've been through
The hard times, we live and lose
Take my hand and I will lead you to something new
You and I will walk in time
There's no need to run and hide
Take my hand and I will show you my love is true
And I'll sing it

Shout it out, sing it loud, I've got something to say
You're the one that I want and I'm screaming your name
Can I kiss you cause the night is closing in
Oh I, oh I, I'm ready for it
I come alive, I feel alive when you walk my way
There's a room in my heart, do you wanna stay
And I'll show you that you're all I'm thinking of
Oh I, oh I, I'm ready for love

Oh I, oh I, I'm ready for love"

Rock,"On the road for forty days,
Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze.
Sweet, sweet Connie -- doin' her act,
She had the whole show and that's a natural fact.
Up all night with Freddy King,
I got to tell you poker's his thing.
A-booze 'n ladies keep me right,
As long as we can make it to the show tonight.

We're an American band.
We're an American band.
We're coming to your town, we'll help you party it down.
We're an American band.


Four young chaquitas in Omaha,
Was waitin' for the band to return from the show.
Feelin' good, feelin' right, it's Saturday night,
The hotel detective -- he was out-a-sight.
Now, these fine ladies, they had a plan,
They was out to meet the boys in the band.
They said, ""Come on, dudes, let's get it on,""
And we proceeded to tear that hotel down.

Rock,"A perfect day to get out of bed
shower, dress, shave, kiss you on the head
Then I hit the office and my head starts to swim

A perfect day to just walk around
see a violent movie, check the sounds
But even on the street
when I hear a phone ring my heart starts to beat
when I get home I don't want you to speak

Don't talk to me about work
please don't talk to me about work
I'm up to my eyeballs in dirt
with work, with work

How many dollars, how many sales
how many liars, how many tales
How many insults must you take in this one life

I'm in prison most of the day
so please excuse me, if I get this way
But I have got obligations to keep
so be very careful when you speak

Don't talk to me about work
please don't talk to me about work
I'm up to my eyeballs in dirt
with work, with work

Please don't talk to me about work
don't you talk to me about work
I'm up to my eyeballs in dirt

And never brought to mind?

Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And days of Auld Lang Syne.

And days of Auld Lang Syne, my friend,
And days of Auld Lang Syne.
we'll drink a cup of kindness yet
To days of Auld Lang Syne."
Rock,"If I could find a way, would I become like you, yeah?
If I could throw myself away, would I become like you?
Would I know just where I stood?
Would my heart be made out of wood?

If I could be a brick, would I become like you, yeah?
If I could give my best friend a kick, would I become like you?
Would I know just where I was at?
Would my brains be where I sat?
Would I become like you?

Pop,"Right there on the sidewalk we met after dark
Your friend gave you a ride you step out of his car
The moon lit up the street
It was the middle of july
But it was cold like november that night
You're looking right at me and I'm looking away
You're telling me everything I'm too scared to say
Say my eyes are like something
That you've never seen before and I can't help but fall

And I know that I'm so far gone I'm so gone right now
He knows I'm down and he'll knock me out
Just one more look and he'll burn me down
He'll burn me down

With our hearts on fire we lit up
The night left our fears behind
Running for our lives like we'd never die
And it felt like magic but I knew I couldn't have it
We were just so close it's tragic
We could feel the burn of our hearts on fire
Our hearts on fire

I can't even breathe you're like a shooting star
I know you could burn out but I can't see that far
Get a little closer and the sparks shine in your eyes
And I don't stand a chance

And I know it's a long way down but I'm holding on
You flash that smile my hearts giving out
There's no way I could forget you now
Forget you now

With our hearts on fire we lit up the night
Left our fears behind
Running for our lives like we'd never die
And it felt like magic but I knew I couldn't have it
We were just so close it's tragic
We could feel the burn of our hearts on fire
Our hearts on fire

He was freedom he was magic
I was on fire it was tragic
Had my walls up but he broke me down
And the sparks fly all around
And the sparks fly all around

With our hearts on fire we lit up the night
Left our fears behind
Running for our lives like we'd never die
And it felt like magic but I knew I couldn't have it
We were just so close it's tragic
We could feel the burn of our hearts on fire
Our hearts on fire
Of our hearts on fire
Our hearts on fire
Hearts on fire
Of our hearts on fire
Our hearts on fire"
Rock,"When I was a young boy
I was raised in Africa
In a little village
Deep in the heart of Kenya
I remember one time
I was outside hunting game
When I heard the thunder
Of a storm that frightened me


Suddenly
All around me darkness
And I could feel
Something evil near me
Closing in
So I started running
I tried to hide
But it overcame me


I became a prisoner of
The spell that entered me
And the same thing happened
To my friends and family
In the yeart that followed
Drought and famine filled the land
Many days of sorrow
Endless nights of burning pain


Suddenly
A light appeared before me
And I could see
The virgin shining on me
And in her arms
Was the child inside me
And I could feel
"
Rock,"Do you always trust your first initial feeling
Special knowledge holds truth
Bears believing
I turned around
And the water was closing all around
Like a glove
Like the love that had finally, finally found me
And I knew
In the crystalline knowledge of you
Drove me through the mountains
Through the crystal like a clear water fountain
Drove me like a magnet
To the sea
To the sea
To the sea, yeah

How the faces of love have changed
Turning the pages
And I have changed oh, but you
You remain ageless
I turned around
And the water was closing all around
Like a glove
Like the love that had finally, finally found me
And I knew
In the crystalline knowledge of you
Drove me through the mountains
Through the crystal like a clear water fountain
Drove me like a magnet
To the sea
To the sea
To the sea, yeah
To the sea, yeah

I turned around and the water was closing around me
I turned around and the water was closing around me

"
Rock,"I gave you pictures and cards on non-holidays
And it wasn't because I was bored
I followed you from room to room, with no attention
And it wasn't because I was bored

It was because I was loving you so much
That's the only reason I gave my time to you
And that's it, that's the kick in you giving up
'Cause you know you won't like it, when there's nothing to do

Check out that rack of his, look at that row of guitar necks
Lined up like eager Fillies, outstretched like legs of Rockettes
They don't know what they are in for, and they don't care, but I do
I thought you would wail on me, like you wail on them
But it was just a coochie-coo-coups

And meanwhile, I'm loving you so much
It's the only reason I gave my time to you
And that's it, that's the kick in you giving up
'Cause you know you won't like it, when there's nothing to do

Meanwhile, I'm loving you so much
That's the only reason that I gave my time to you
And that's it, that's the kick in you giving up
'Cause you know you don't like it, when there's nothing to do

And I've been used so many times
I've learned to use myself in kind
I try to drum, I try to write
I can't do either well, but alright, it's fine, I guess
'Cause I know how to spend my time
I know how to spend my time
I know how to spend my time
I know how to spend my time

Meanwhile, I'm loving you so much
Meanwhile, I'm loving you so much
Meanwhile, I'm loving you so much"
Pop,"Feels like I'm lost in the ocean, just drifting
Drowning from the weight of my thoughts
Like I just don't know who I am
Like I just don't know who I want to be in this big world

Don't even know what I'm doing
If I'm going down the right road
That's gonna lead me to my dreams
That's gonna take me to a place I never thought I'd be
I don't wanna be good
I just wanna be great
Just wanna be the best that I can be
I just wanna be the best
Never settle for less
Go to places in the world I've never seen
I'd never seen

Someone like you
Someone like you
Cause you wrap me up with love
And I can see I start to change
I can face the world
As long as I know that you're next to me
Someone like you
Someone like you
Any room that you walk into become such a better place
And I can see what I've been missing
And what I will always need
Someone like you

Feels like I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere
Don't know what direction to run
I pray I choose the right one
Cause if I do then I'll be one step closer to what I want
And everytime I think about what I dream of at night
All that I can see is you
You told me that you want me too
I just wish that it was true
I can see one day we'll be on top just me and you

'CauseI don't wanna be good
I just wanna be great
Just wanna be the best that I can be
I just wanna be the best
Never settle for less
Go to places in the world I've never seen
I'd never seen

Someone like you
Cause you wrap me up with love
And I can see I start to change
I can face the world
As long as I know that you're next to me
Someone like you
Someone like you
Any room that you walk into become such a better place
And I can see what I've been missing
And what I will always need
Someone like you

Everybody's watching
Every move we make
And everybody's talking
Let them say what they gon' say
Cause they hating on me
Lying on you
The only thing true is the two of us

It's you
It's you
It's you
Someone like you
Someone like you
Cause you wrap me up with love
And I can see I start to change
I can face the world
As long as I know that you're next to me
Someone like you (you)
Someone like you
Any room that you walk into become such a better place

And I can see what I've been missing
And what I will always need

Rock,"Now if you want my love today,
if you want my sorrow,
It won&acute;t rain unless you pray

Rainbows come when rains are done,
fills the sky with colored sun,
My love&acute;s inside the rainbow.

Now if you have to go away,
won&acute;t be back tomorrow.
Take your time but ev&acute;ry day

Rainbows.........

Now if you don&acute;t know how to say
that you live in sorrow
If no love has come your way

Rainbows..........

Pop,"I've disappointed you, I know
But I've learned that wholeheartedly
I want you back
And I'm sad, sad that I hurt you so wrong
Now I'm here taking so seriously my monogamy

Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't, don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me

If I could turn back time, I would
Every word say it so differently if I could
But here in the present tense for us
Let me show you what I would do for your love
I'll be a priest or a saint
Be a lion you can tame
Give you wings to be free
Be the balance you need
I'll be a martyr or a hero
Be the answer when you don't know
I can change what you see
Tell me better so please, please, please

Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't, don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me

Hope you can hear my voice right here
Why does it feel that you're so far away but so near
We've escaped from the loudest voice so now
We can conquer any mountain without falling down
I'll be a priest or a saint
Be a lion you can tame
Give you wings to be free
Be the balance you need
I'll be a martyr or a hero
Be the answer when you don't know
I can change what you see
Tell me better so please, please, please

Help me now
If the lord is looking down
Help me now
If the lord, lord's looking down
Help me now
If the lord, lord's looking down
Help me please

I'll be a leader

I'll always see you

I'll be a fighter

Rock,"Free to run like the wind on a Summer day
Heart worn like a ring around the moon
And your eyes are ablaze
Reflections of time passing by
That remind you there's much more to life
Than standing still
Or running from place to place in the heat of
the day
Just follow your heart and you'll see ...
There's more to life

There beyond the horizon there's another day
Far above the pain and fear you feel
The power and the pace
The greatest sensation of all
There's much more to life than you'll ever know
The rise and fall, there'll always be you and me
We're moving as one
So follow your heart and you'll see ...
There's more to life

We all have our dreams
We all have our visions
But time after time we're faced with decisions
Which road to follow?
How hard to fight?
Then you wake up and see
That there's more to life

Free in acres of sky on a Summer day
Fire that burns with hope inside your heart
We are never apart
Reflections of time passing by
That remind you there's much more to life
So follow your heart and you'll see
If you follow your heart you'll be free
'Cos there's more to life
So much more to life
More to life"
Rock,"what's wrong baby?
don't they treat you like they should?
did you take them for it?
for every penny that you could?
we once walked out on the beach and once i almost touched your hand
oh, how i dreamed to finally say such things
then only to pretend

don't you know what i'm thinking? (know what i'm thinking)
driving 405 past midnight
you know that I miss you (don't you know that I miss you)
ninth and ash on a tuesday night
i would write to you from museum mile
a toast to you:
your whisper, your smile
up the stairs at the wheatherford
a ghost each place i hide

if you don't don't know, why'd you say so?
would you mean this please if it happens?
if you don't know, why would you say so?
won't you get your story straight?
if you don't know, honey why'd you just say so?
'cuz i need this now more than i ever did
if you don't know honey, then you don't

i left you waiting (i know i left you waiting)
at the least could we be friends?
should have never started (never started)
ain't that the way it always ends?
on my life i'll try today
there's so much i've felt i should say but
even if your heart would listen i doubt i could explain

if you don't don't know, why'd you say so?
would you mean this please if it happens?
if you don't know, why would you say so?
won't you get your story straight?
if you don't know, honey why'd you just say so?
'cuz i need this now more than i ever did
if you don't, well honey then you don't
if you don't, well honey then you don't

so here we are now
a sip of wine, a sip of water
someday maybe
maybe someday we'll be smarter
and i'm sorry that i'm such a mess
i drank all my money could get,
and i took everything you let me have and then i never loved you back

if you don't don't know, why'd you say so?
would you mean this please if it happens?
if you don't know, why would you say so?
won't you get your story straight?
if you don't know, honey why'd you just say so?
'cuz i need this now now, need this, need this
if you dont well honey, then you don't
if you dont well honey, then you don't
if you don't well honey, then you don't

if you don't know honey, honey then you don't...

Rock,"The tactful cactus by your window
Surveys the prairie of your room
Mobile spins to its collision
Clara puts her head between her paws
They've opened shops down West side
Will all the cacti find a home
But the key to the city
Is in the sun that pins the branches to the sky"
Rock,"Are you all sitting comftybold two square on your botty? then i'll begin.


Once upon a time in a land of greens,
Where the sky was silky soft and full of coloured dreams,
Deep inside a rainbow lived Happiness Stan,
In a small Victoriana charabanc.

Evening will be here quite soon,
Stan can sit and watch the moon,
Watching as the white light,
Slowly makes the night bright,
Hours slipping by while time stands still.

Aaaaah, aaaaah, aaaaah, aaaaah.

Think of black and black will think for you,
It's coloured Stan in bruises, of the darkness that he knew,
For black had stolen half the moon away.

Aaaaah, aaaah, aaaah, aaaah, aaaah, aaaah, aaaah,
Aaaah, aaaah, aaaah, aaaah,
Aaaaah, aaaah, aaaah, aaaah, aaaah.

Rock,"Come rest you weary gentlemen
let nothing you dismay
lay down your swords and fight no more
for the sake of Christmas Day

A saviour came down to this earth
to show us everyone
how to live in harmony
together under the sun

Beyond the dark horizon
Lies a far more bountiful land
Void of all starvation
For every woman and man.

so reach out from the wilderness
and pray to heaven above
a future lies in wait for us
a world united in love

We don't need a merry Christmas
we don't need a Happy New Year
the only wish on Santa's list
is that one day there will be
peace on this earth

Through the valleys
over the hills
church bells echo their sound
whispers travelling through the trees
over the snow covered ground
spread the message far and wide
so every one can hear
home fires glow on angel wings
and banishes every tear

We don't need a merry Christmas
we don't need a Happy New Year
the only wish on Santa's list
is that one day there will be
peace on this earth

Grant us .. one wish
no more .. pain or sorrow
hear us .. help us
build a new tommorrow

So reach out from the wilderness
and pray to heaven above
a future lies in wait for us
a world united in love

We don't need a merry Christmas
we don't need a Happy New Year
the only wish on Santa's list
is that one day there will be

No more tears or pain at Christmas
no more children living in fear
the only wish on Santa's list
is that one day there will be
one day there will be
one day there will be
peace on this earth

Grant us .. our wish this Christmas"
Rock,"She wore faded jeans and soft black leather
She had eyes so blue they looked like weather
When she needed me I wasn't around
That's the way it goe s, it'll all work out

There were times apart, there were times together
I was pledged to her for worse or better
When it mattered most I let her down
That's the way it goes, it'll all work out

It'll all work out eventually
Better off with him than here with me

It'll all work out eventually
Maybe better with him than here with me

Now the wind is high and the rain is heavy
And the water's rising in the levee
Still I think of her when the sun go es down
It never goes away, but it all works out

Rock,"As soon as you're born they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all.
A working class hero is something to be,
A working class hero is something to be.

They hurt you at home and they hit you at school,
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules.
A working class hero is something to be,
A working class hero is something to be.

When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career,
But you really can't function you're so full of fear.
A working class hero is something to be,
A working class hero is something to be.

Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV
And you think you're so clever and classless and free,
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see.
A working class hero is something to be,
A working class hero is something to be.

There's room at the top they are telling us still,
But first we must learn how to smile as we kill
If we want to live like the folks on the hill.
A working class hero is something to be,
A working class hero is something to be.

A working class hero is something to be,

Do they all look like mine?

Try it for sleeping instead
Maybe you'll rest sometime

The world held his hand, gave their pledge
So he told them his scheme for a Saviour Machine

They called it the Prayer, its answer was law
Its logic stopped war, gave them food
How they adored till it cried in its boredom

'Please don't believe in me, please disagree with me
Life is too easy, a plague seems quite feasible now
or maybe a war, or I may kill you all

Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine

I need you flying, and I'll show that dying
Is living beyond reason, sacred dimension of time
I perceive every sign, I can steal every mind

Don't let me stay, don't let me stay

Pop,"I'm giving you only the truth.
This is your last chance.
After me there will be no more.
If you hear your self concience, you will stay in wonderland,
And I will show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

Alice lives in a land that I am envious of.
Yellow dragons, violet cats and black talking purple knobs.
She steps on anything that might get in her way of home.
You. alice had love but she pushed all of her people away.
She felt as if she was alone, distant, ugly, afraid.
She didn't know that her life was already made.

You're loved and you will find someone with your frame of mind.
So if you would be so kind to not cross that line:
And fall into a world where everything is flipped:
And where you fly to swim and you fly to drive.

Fly with me in the sea, swim with me in the breeze.
Drive with me on the clouds, fly with me on the ground.
Follow me into my rabbit hole, and I'll show you everything I've been told:
And I'll lead you to a land unknown, where happiness is grown.

I live in a world that alice would be envious of.
Everybody's mind is closed there falls a white dove.
Find your treasured feather and you better treat it right.
Petals can unfold all at one time or all at the drop of a dime.
With tragic reds and joyous reds of a blue yesterday,
It makes me crazy to hear of you purple yellow haze.
Alice had it great, I wanna be like her some day.
In a world where everything is flipped and people are stuck in the maze.

Fly with me in the sea, swim with me in the breeze,
Drive with me on the clouds, fly with me on the ground.
Follow me into my rabbit hole, and I'll show you everything I've been told.
And I'll lead you to a land unknown, where happiness is grown."

Give me one good reason
why my baby ain't the lead
[Spitz:]
Ok, your baby can't act
[Raven:]
What?
[Spitz:]
He can't shoot, and he sure can't rap
[Raven:]
Well if you really want a piece of this pie
I bet you'll get past that

'Cause you ain't never had something so good
Hot and Fresh out of the oven
Honey, you ain't getting none
I said hey, you'll testify
if you want a piece of this pie
I said hey you better make it right
if you want a piece of this pie
You better let my baby shine
or you get no key-lime
I said hey, you'll testify
if you want a piece of this pie

[Raven:]
Now, if he's not the lead
what part can he play?
[Spitz:]
Uh, I could give him front row seats (No pie)
How about something behind the scenes? (No pie)
Just a little piece? (No pie)
Pretty, pretty please? (No pie)
I got it he can play a tree
[Raven:]
Hmm... you don't want no pie!

You ain't never never had something so good
Hot and fresh out the oven
Honey you ain't getting none
I said hey

Sweet potato, cherry, lemon, Apple strudel
Each one is delicious
but there's nothing for you though

I said hey
Testify, if you want a piece of this pie
I said hey, You better make it right
if you want a piece of this pie
You better let my baby shine
or you get no key-lime
I said Hey
Testify, if you want a piece of this pie

[Spitz:]
I got it, he can play Ref number one
[Raven:]
Any lines?
[Spitz:] he's got a whistle (No pie)
[Raven:]
How many times does he blow it?
[Spitz:]
It's for showin', not blowin' (No pie)
Alright, one
okay two gut wrenching whistles
[Raven:]
Now you get a piece
now you get a piece of this pie
now you get a piece of this pie"
Rock,"The first star I see
May not be a star
We can't do a thing but wait
So let's wait
For one more
And the time, such clumsy time
In deciding if it's time
I'm careful but not sure how it goes
You can lose yourself in your courage
When the time we have now ends
When the big hand goes round again
Can you still feel the butterflies?
Can you still hear the last goodnight?
And the mindless comfort grows
When I'm alone with my great plans
This is what she says that gets her through it:
""If i don't let myself be happy now then when?""
If not now
When the time we have now ends
When the big hand goes round again
Can you still feel the butterflies?
Can you still hear the last goodnight?
I close my eyes and believe
Wherever you are you're an angel for me
When the time we have now ends
When, the big hand goes round again
Can you still feel the butterflies?
Can you still hear the last goodnight?

Rock,"Oh, hear this Robert Zimmerman
I wrote a song for you
About a strange young man called Dylan
With a voice like sand and glue
Some words of truthful vengeance
They could pin us to the floor
Brought a few more people on
And put the fear in a whole lot more

Ah, Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

You gave your heart to every bedsit room
At least a picture on the wall
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes
And told them how they saw
Then we lost your train of thought
The paintings are all your own
While troubles are rising
We'd rather be scared
Together than alone

Ah, Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

Aoo

Now hear this Robert Zimmerman
Though I don't suppose we'll meet
Ask your good friend Dylan
If he'd gaze a while down the old street
Tell him we've lost his poems
So they're writing on the walls
Give us back our unity
Give us back our family
You're every nation's refugee
Don't leave us with their sanity

Ah, Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Come on
A couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Oh, here she comes, (oh) here she comes

Pop,"Excuse me, your heart is in my heart
Hello, you've taken this too far

Am I just a piece you push in your board game?
Have you been laughing all day long?
You like it when it's hard for me to see straight
You make it go on and on and on and on and on

Save your goodbye
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go, go, go

I beg your pardon, you're standing on my love
Hello, have you not had enough?

But am I just a piece you push in your board game?
Have you been laughing all day long?
You like it when its hard for me to see straight

You're everywhere I go, go, go, go, go

Yeah, it's my time to shine and my sword is true
You're back inside my mind, I can still remember
I say I'm chasin' dreams but you know
I've been runnin' away from, runnin' away from you

Some sort of comfort in your pain, I can't help but take it
No matter how I change there'll be no escapin'
I say I'm chasin' time but you know
I've been runnin' away, runnin' away from you

Save your goodbyee

Rock,"He's got a smile
And it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
But everything was as fresh as a bright blue sky

Now and then when I see his face
It takes me away to that special place
And if I stand too long
I'll probably break down and cry

Sweet child 'o mine
Sweet love of mine

He's got eyes of the bluest skies
And if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
His hair reminds me
Of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by

Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love of mine

Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go

Sweet child o' mine"
Pop,"Never give up hope
You know it does happen to people when you least expect it

Hard day, long road
A lot of time tryna make it gold
So far from home
I can't remember where I left my soul
If I'm here and you're there
I got a picture of your everywhere
In my heart, in my mind
And it'll be until the end of my time

Face down like a domino
In a place I will never know
Sometimes yeah you need to go
Yeah you need to go
Where the river runs home

Countin' up the days
And the ways I'm gonna make it happen
I feel the walls are tumbling
I see the doors are opening
It's been a long time
But I know that you've been waiting for me
And the world will always spin
'Cause love will always win

Love will always, love will always
Love will always win

I live up in my dreams
Gotta rule, gotta play the scene
Your face on my screen
And I remember how it feels to be
You're mine, our lives
I couldn't get better if I tried
I'll run, jump heights
Just to make it back by your side

Grey sky and I feel the cold
Another pain in another club
Sometimes yeah you need to go
Yeah you need to go
Where the river runs home

Countin' up the days
And the ways I'm gonna make it happen
I feel the walls are tumbling
I see the doors are opening
It's been a long time
But I know that you've been waiting for me
And the world will always spin
'Cause love will always win

Love will always, love will always
Love will always win
Love will always, love will always
Love will always win

Face down like a domino
In a place I will never know
Sometimes yeah you need to go
Yeah you need to go
Where the river runs home

Countin' up the days
And the ways I'm gonna make it happen
I feel the walls are tumbling
I see the doors are opening
It's been a long time
But I know that you've been waiting for me
And the world will always spin
'Cause love will always win

Love will always, love will always
Love will always win
Love will always, love will always
Love will always win

Love will always, love will always
Love will always win
Love will always, love will always
Love will always win"
Rock,"Way back when in fifty eight
We had a move that move was great
We could walk and stroll and susie q
We could do that crazy hand jive too

Remember a cat called way out Willie
A cool cat called rockin' Billy
Mama said to Willie you'll ruin my home
And you and that hand jive have got to go
'Cos he was hand jivin' he was hand jivin'
He would hand jive day and night hand jive

Willie had a girl called jivin' Jilly
Inhibitions she didn't have any
Willie would stop Jilly kept cryin'
To let him do that hand jive one more time
They were hand jivin' they were hand jivin'
They would hand jive day and night
Hand jive day and night

Willie and Jilly got married one fall
They had a little Willie Junior and that's not all
Little Willie got famous and it's plain to see
That he did that hand jive on tv

They were hand jivin' they were hand jivin'
They would hand jive day and night hand jive
Always hand jivin' yeah hand jivin'
We would hand jive day and night hand jive

I can remember about fifty four
Rock'n'roll was at my door
Fifty five and Elvis was king
Rock'n'roll was everything
Fifty six fifty seven rock'n'roll carried me to heaven
And looking in on fifty eight
They opened up that pearly gate
We could rock we could roll
Everyone could do the stroll
Dancin' just to stay alive
We all did the crazy hand jive"
Rock,"Well ever since you were a little girl
You set the rules in your little world
But girls grow up and throw their toys away
You're a big girl now but you still wanna play
(Girl we're living)
You dress them up the way you want to
(Girl we're living)
You make them do just what you want them to do
(Girl we're living)
Once I thought we had a love that was true
But I'm just another doll in your dollhouse to you
We're living in a dollhouse
We're living in a dollhouse
Girl we're living in a dollhouse
You may feel safe and sound
But your dollhouse, girl, is falling down

It's all been neatly arranged in your mind
Every detail fits your own design
Every room is perfectly in place
But I can see the sadness, baby, on your face
You had a plan and darling like a child
You thought it's down to fashion, down to style
But your little dreamhouse is runnin' wild
Before your very eyes we're shrinking down to size
We're living in a dollhouse
We're living in a dollhouse
Girl we're living in a dollhouse
We may feel safe and sound
But our dollhouse, girl, is falling down

Everything's as you dreamed it would be
But there's something wrong that you can't see
Room by room you keep looking for some little flaw
A crack somewhere in your dollhouse wall
Something, girl, that will explain away
The hurt you feel, darling, when we play

Your little dolls they got a grip on you
Until you're just another doll in your dollhouse too
We're living in a dollhouse
Girl, we're living in a dollhouse
Oh we're living in a dollhouse
We may feel safe and sound
But our dollhouse, girl, is falling down
Oh we're living in a dollhouse
Girl, we're living in a dollhouse
Yeah we're living in a dollhouse

Pop,"I believe starry eyes, with every drop there's a healing
Let it be, let 'em cry
but just don't keep the pain inside, inside
Let go of the pain inside, inside

Don't keep it together, oh, let it run away
Don't hold back the river, let go, let it run away
Before it makes you numb, it will only make you numb
And you won't be numb
Numb

Now you're free, you can fly, can you feel your heart now?
It's beating
You'll see paradise
just don't get lost in the pain inside, inside
Let go of the pain inside, inside

Don't keep it together, oh, let it run away
Don't hold back the river, let go, let it run away
Before it makes you numb, it will only make you numb
And you won't be numb
Numb
And you won't be numb
Numb
It will only make you numb
And you won't be"
Pop,"I didn't have a care or worry
I wasn't in the slightest hurry
To fall in love and give my heart away oh baby
So hurt many times before that I said this time for sure
I was locking up the door then baby
Ooh, you came you saw you conquered all the love in me
Ooh, you came you saw you turned your loving right on in me ooh ooh ooh

My enemy was warm desire
You shot me down with lips of fire
I ran for cover straight into your arms oh baby
Footloose and fancy free, nobody could get a hold of me
Then you kissed me tenderly and baby
Ooh, you came you saw you conquered all the love in me, oh baby
Ooh, you came you saw you turned your loving right on in me ooh ooh ooh

Goodbye heart of mine
Hello sweet ties of love that bind
I'll try love just this one more time, cause baby
Ooh, you came you saw you conquered all the love in me, oh baby
Ooh, you came you saw you turned your loving right on in me ooh ooh ooh

Ooh ooh ooh"
Pop,"When we were together
We were just strangers
I was just playing around
So I didn't wanna work it out
Yeah, I didn't wanna work it out

Got something else missing
We were too different
Baby I've been looking back now
I really should've worked it out
Yeah, I really should've worked it out

Because now that you're gone
And I sleep alone
I can't help it, I want you back
'Cause I

Boy I miss you
Said I really do
Boy I miss you
Now I understand that we're better together
Boy I miss you
Said I really, really do
Boy I miss you
Now I understand that we're better together
We're better
You know we're better together

You know we're better together

Wishing you were never
Thinking I didn't wanna have you
I was like I was so dumb
Boy I should've known that you're the one
Yeah, I should've known that you're the one

So if it's not too late
I just wanna know
If maybe we can see what went wrong
Because I really know that you're the one
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that you're the one

Because now that you're gone
And I sleep alone
I can't help it, I want you back

Boy I miss you
Said I really do

You don't understand that we're better together

Said I really, really do

Rock,"I knew the first time we meet we'd be lovers,
last time we kissed I was blue.
First time you left I discovered,
that there won't be another like you.
Forever young, love will always be.
Forever young, love will always be.

( Solo 1 )

Every day you were gone I was lonely,
each night you were gone I was blue.
Now darling I'll be with you only,
and our love will always be true.
Forever young, love will always be.
Forever young, our love will always be.

( Solo 2 )

And to the end I know I will love only you.
I knew the first time we meet we'd be lovers,
last time we kissed I was blue.
The first time you left I discovered,

Forever young, love will always be.
Forever young, love will always be.

Rock,"Treat me like a fool,
Treat me mean and cruel,
But love me.
Wring my faithful heart,
Tear it all apart,
But love me.
If you ever go,
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
I'll be sad and blue,
Crying over you, dear only.
I would beg and steal
Just to feel your heart
Beatin' close to mine

Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
I'll be sad and blue,
Crying over you, dear only.

Pop,"Hey

I'm a lazy boy
If you were here, you could be a hater

Yeah

I used to shave before
But It seems that I've lost my razor

All your shit is in my room
Your records and your old iPhone

Rather be alone, I don't wanna go
Hang with people you and I know

I just wanna stay home…

And eat cereal three times a day

Don't wash my clothes, I watch HBO, Uh ha
And my new girlfriend, she's in Game Of Thrones, Uh ha

Don't lock the door, clean up the floor, or care any more, uh-uh

I just eat Cereal

Yo

I got a tinder date
If you were here we could get takeaway

No

She, don't cook that good
An in her profile pic she wasn't overweight

All your shit is in my room
your records and your old iPhone

Rather be alone, I don't wanna go
hang with people you and I know

I just wanna stay home…

And eat cereal three times a day

Don't lock the door, clean up the floor, or care any more, Uh ha

I just eat cereal"
Pop,"There's a whole in my heart
Lying here in the dark
Wishing we could be starting again
Oh but everything changed
When I threw it away
Maybe we could try to pretend yeah
That I never let you down
No I never run around
And no your not gonna be leavin' leavin' leavin'

No need for you to go yanno
Why I'm sinking like a song
C'mon won't you let me down easy easy easy

Cause you know that I'm still in love
And I guess it's just not enough
But at least we had our moment in the the sun
Yeah I can apologize
But I see it in your eyes
That I could never make it right before I let you go
Just you and I girl just for tonight girl
And let me hold you one last time
It's you and I girl just for tonight girl

Leave your bags by the door
And my heart on the floor
There's no single word I can say
When I see you with him
And it's only as friends
Will I only be in your way

No need for you to go yanno
Why I'm sinking like a song
C'mon won't you let me down easy easy easy

Cause you know that I'm still in love
And I guess it's just not enough
But at least we had our moment in the the sun
Yeah I can apologize
But I see it in your eyes
That I could never make it right before I let you go
Just you and I girl just for tonight girl
And let me hold you one last time
It's you and I girl just for tonight girl

No don't you leave this way
I'm begging you to stay now baby
Just give me one more day
And maybe maybe

Cause you know that I'm still in love
And I guess it's just not enough
But at least we had our moment in the the sun
Yeah I can apologize
But I see it in your eyes
That I could never make it right before I let you go (I let you go)
Just you and I girl (just you and I) just for tonight girl (just you and I
Girl)
And let me hold you one last time (one last time)
It's you and I girl (it's you and I) just for tonight girl (just for tonight)"
Rock,"a) Waltzing Matilda

Waltzing Matilda whipped out her wallet
the sexy boy smiled in dismay
She took out four twenties 'cause she liked round figures
everybody's queen for a day
Oh, babe, I'm on fire and you know I admire your -
- body why don't we slip away
Although I'm sure you're certain, it's a rarity me flirtin'
sha-la-la-la, this way

Oh, sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
hey, baby, come on, let's slip away

Luscious and gorgeous, oh what a humpin' muscle
call out the national guard
She creamed in her jeans as he picked up her knees
from off of the formica topped bar
And cascading slowly, he lifted her wholly
and boldly out of this world
And despite people's derision
proved to be more than diversion
sha-la-la-la, later on

And then sha-la-la-la-la, he entered her slowly
and showed her where he was coming from
And then sha-la-la-la-la, he made love to her gently
it was like she'd never ever come
And then sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
when the sun rose and he made to leave
You know, sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
neither one regretted a thing


b) Street Hassle

Hey, that cunt's not breathing
I think she's had too much
of something or other, hey, man, you know what I mean?
I don't mean to scare you
but you're the one who came here
and you're the one who's gotta take her when you leave
I'm not being smart
or trying to be cold on my part
and I'm not gonna wear my heart on my sleeve
But you know people get all emotional
and sometimes, man, they just don't act rational you know,
they think they're just on TV

Sha-la-la-la, man
why don't you just slip her away

You know, I'm glad that we met man
it really was nice talking
and I really wish that there was a little more time to speak
But you know it could be a hassle
trying to explain this all to a police officer
about how it was that your old lady got herself stiffed
And it's not like we could help
but there wasn't nothing no one could do
and if there was, man, you know I would have been the first
But when someone turns that blue
well, it's a universal truth
and then you just know that bitch will never fuck again
By the way, that's really some bad shit
that you came to our place with
but you ought to be more careful around the little girls
It's either the best or it's the worst
and since I don't have to choose
I guess I won't and I know this ain't no way to treat a guest
But why don't you grab your old lady by the feet
and just lay her out in the darkest street
and by morning, she's just another hit and run.
You know, some people got no choice
and they can never find a voice
to talk with that they can even call their own
So the first thing that they see
that allows them the right to be
why they follow it, you know, it's called bad luck.


c) Slipaway

Believe me (man), that's just a lie,
it's a lie she tells her friends.
'cause the real song, the real song
that she won't even admit to herself
[is] the beat in her heart.
It's a song lots of people know.
It's a painful song
but I wrote a sad truth
but alas for sad songs
a painful wish.
But wishin' won't make it so, Joe
With a pretty kiss for a pretty face
can't have its way
Y'know tramps like us, we were born to pay.

Love has gone away
and there's no one here now
And there's nothing left to say
but, oh, how I miss him, baby
Oh, baby, come on and slip away
come on, baby, why don't you slip away

Love is gone away
took the rings off my fingers
And there's nothing left to say
but, oh how, oh how I need him, baby
Come on, baby, I need you baby
oh, please don't slip away
I need your loving so bad, babe
please don't slip away

"
Rock,"And if I die today I'll be the happy phantom
and I'll go chasin' the nuns out in the yard
and I'll run naked through the streets without my mask on
and I will never need umbrellas in the rain
I'll wake up in strawberry fields everyday
and the atrocities of school I can forgive
The happy phantom has no right to bitch

Oo who- The time is getting closer
Oo who- Time to be a ghost
Oo who- Everyday we're getting closer
The sun is getting dim
Will we pay for who we been

So if I die today I'll be the happy phantom
And I'll go wearin' my naughties like a jew
They'll be my ticket to the universal opera
There's Judy Garland taking Buddha by the hand
and then these seven little men get up to dance
They say Confucius does his crossword with a pen
I'm still the angel to the girl who hates to sin

Oo whoo- The time is gettin closer
Oo who- The time to be a ghost
Oo who- Everyday we're getting closer
The sun is getting dim
Will I pay for who I been

Or will I see you dear and wish I could come back
You found a girl that you could truly love again
Will you still call for me when she falls asleep
or do we soon forget the things we cannot see

Oo who- The time is getting closer
Oo who- The time to be a ghost
Oo who- Everyday we're getting closer
The sun is getting dim
Will I pay for who I been

And if I die today
And if I die today
And if I die today
Chasin' nuns out in the yard

Rock,"strong enough
God, I feel like hell tonight
Tears of rage I cannot fight
I'd be the last to help you understand
Are you strong enough to be my man?

Nothing's true and nothing's right
So let me be alone tonight
Cause you can't change the way I am
Are you strong enough to be my man?

Lie to me
I promise I'll believe
Lie to me
But please don't leave

I have a face I cannot show
I make the rules up as I go
It's try and love me if you can
Are you strong enough to be my man?

When I've shown you that I just don't care
When I'm throwing punches in the air
When I'm broken down and I can't stand
Will you be strong enough to be my man?

Lie to me
I promise I'll believe
Lie to me
But please don't leave
"
Pop,"84 was a pretty good year
I lost my heart back then in 1984

It was 1984 and I was nearly 16 years
Oh Thatcher was the minister in charge
Oh the miners were on strike
And my dad had gone away
And the Swiss were riding high up in the charts
It was there on Gordod Road
While I was waiting in the cold
For my mate when you came along
And heaven knows that it was like a heart attack
That year when you said to me

Chorus:
If you give a little bit more
Just a little bit more
You'll get a little bit more
If you try a little bit harder
Just a little bit harder
Then you'll get it for sure
You'll get it for sure

I was nervous,I was sweating
Seemed like she was on a mission
When she took me by the hand up to her room
There were posters on her wall
I saw flowers in her hair
But I never got the chance to see them bloom

'Cause the clock stopped
And the years rolled by
But the time never left my mind
When she said

Chorus

Twenty-four years later
And we're in the hands of labour
and we've got ten thousand troops out in Iraq
I am living now in London
And at present I am single
And in somewhere died along since you come back

84 was a pretty good year
I lost my heart back then in 1984
Was a pretty good year
I lost my heart to 1984

Chorus

1984

Rock,"Out in the cold world and far away from home
Somebody's boy is wandering alone
No one to guide him and keep his footsteps right
Somebody's boy is homeless tonight

Out in the hallway there stands a vacant chair
Yonder's the shoes my darling used to wear
Empty the cradle, the one that's loved so well
How I miss him, there's no tongue can tell

Bring back my boy, my wandering boy
Far, far away, wherever he may be
Tell him his mother, with faded cheeks and hair
At their old home is waiting him there

Oh, could I see him and fold him to my breast
Gladly I'd close my eyes and be at rest
There is no other that's left to give me joy
Bring back my boy, my wandering boy

Well I remember the parting words he said
We'll meet again where no sad tears are shed
There'll be no goodbyes in that bright land so fair
When, done with life, I'll meet you up there

Bring back my boy, my wandering boy
Far, far away, wherever he may be
Tell him his mother, with faded cheeks and hair
At their old home is waiting him there"
Rock,"Pack up your bags
Don't look back
There's a little place
Out 'cross the the railroad tracks
If you're broken-hearted
And you don't know what to do
But they got a place down there that's just for you

Club Soul, Club Soul City, yeah yeah yeah
Club Soul, Club Soul City, oh yeah

There's a waitress at the back bar
Goes with the the guy that runs the place
She's got hair like a weeping willow
And tears running down her face
She's seen a lot of guys like you coming around
Looking for something that they've lost
Or trying to lose something that they've found
Down at

Club Soul, Club Soul City, yeah yeah yeah
Club Soul, Club Soul City, oh yeah

So if you're down on your spirit
And there ain't no-one who cares
If you're lost and you're lonely
You won't be lonely down there
You can't miss it, it's just up the highway
On the front door there's a sign that says
Restricted to the losing kind

Club Soul, Club Soul City, yeah yeah yeah
Club Soul, Club Soul City, oh yeah
Club Soul, Club Soul City, yeah yeah yeah
Club Soul, Club Soul City, oh yeah

Rock,"The same heart-the same love
On the night you began

Meant everything-the closest thing
That your heart ever had

But dreams change-change your heart
And interfere with your plans

The same heart-the same love
Are now out of my hands

When two hearts drift away
You can hear the voices say
Tha the real diamond ring
Didn't ever really mean a thing

When two hearts drift away
A lonely voice begins to say
There's no room for anyone
But you're thinking over what you've done

Well here you go-now you're free
Free to go where you please

But when you're free-all you hear
Is your lonely heart beat

When two hearts drift away
You can hear the voices say
Tha the real diamond ring
Didn't ever really mean a thing

When two hearts drift away
A lonely voice begins to say
There's no room for anyone
But you're thinking over what you've done

When two hearts drift away
You can hear the voices say
Tha the real diamond ring
Didn't ever really mean a thing

When two hearts drift away
A lonely voice begins to say
There's no room for anyone
But you're thinking over what you've done

The same heart-the same love
On the night you began

Meant everything-the closest thing
That your heart ever had"
Pop,"I guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood

Unaware but underlined I figured out the story
It wasn't good
But in the corner of my mind I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation you excelled at being free
Can't you find a little room inside for me

Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood

And we'll be together, this time is forever
We'll be fighting and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again"
Rock,"So many years gone
Still I remember
How did I ever let my heart believe
In one who never gave enough to me
And so many years gone
With love that was so wrong
I can't forget the way it used to be
And how you changed the taste of love for me

You were my one more chance
I never thought I'd find
You were the one moment
I'll always have in my mind
No-one will ever touch me more
And I only hope that in return
I might have saved the best of me for you

And we'll have no ending
If we can hold on
And I think I've come this far because of you
Could be no other love but yours will do

You were my one more chance
I never thought I'd find
You were the one moment
I'll always have in my mind
No-one will ever touch me more
And I only hope that in return
I might have saved the best of me for you

No-one will ever touch me more
And I only hope that in return
No matter how much we have to learn
I might have saved the best of me for you

For you
I saved the best of me

You were my one more chance
You were the one romance

(Repeats)"
Rock,"Many indecipherable words

Till the sun blisters and sprays
And every lamb ceases to graze
When the kiss of the comb
Tears my face from the bone

CHORUS
I'll be your light
When the shadows fall down the walls
Then life will be done
And it just won't matter at all

I was caught from a hand
Nurtured on grime, goodwill and screams
Now your breath fills my step
Now there is you till life is gone

CHORUS

I'll roll your ball
Till the stars can't make me cry
Then life will be done
And it just won't matter at all
Not at all

When the kiss of the comb
Tears my face"
Pop,"Ooo! Ooo!

I'm waiting for my moment to come
I'm waiting for the movie to begin
I'm waiting for a revelation
I'm waiting for someone to count me in

'Cause now I only see my dreams, in everything I touch
Feel their cold hands on, everything that I love
Cold like some, magnificent skyline
Out of my reach, but always in my eyeline now

We're tumbling down
We're spiralling
Tied up to the ground
We're spiralling

I fashioned you from jewels and stone
I made you in the image of myself
I gave you everything you wanted
So you would never know anything else

But everytime I reach for you, you slip through my fingers
Into cold sunlight, laughing at the things that
I had planned, the map of my world gets
Smaller as I sit here, pulling at the loose threads now

We're tumbling down
We're spiralling
Tied up to the ground
We're spiralling

Did you wanna be a winner?
Did you wanna be an icon?
Did you wanna be famous?
Did you wanna be the president?
Did you wanna start a war?
Did you wanna have a family?
Did you wanna be in love?
Did you wanna be in love?

When we fall in love
We're just falling (in love)
In love with ourselves
We're spiralling

We're tumbling down
We're spiralling
Tied up to the ground
We're spiralling

Ooo! Ooo!"
Rock,"Taxi Cab, Taxi Cab, at the light
Won't you take me on a ride through this city of night
I got some money and I'm feeling fine
I ain't in no hurry so just take your time
Some people wanna die young and gloriously
But Taxi Cab driver, well that ain't me
I got a cute little baby down at 12th and Vine
And she opens for business just about closing time
Ah hey hey, ah hey hey
City of night, city of night

And I don't believe what I see in this street
I don't know how people they can take the heat
Well baby I'm a liar, I'm a cheat, and I don't care
I got my money, I can take my fare
Ah hey hey, ah hey hey
City of night, city of night

I'm riding tonight to see my sugar girl
You know she wears that dress without a care in the world
Yeah she got come loving that's as bright as the sun
And she brings it with her man when she comes
Hey, hey, city of night
Ah-hey, ah-hey, city of night
Ride on"
Rock,"To my hero
You're calling out to me
The ray of light you shine
Is bright
I wish you could see all the good that you put in my life

I hear you singing
Oh to hear you singing
Songs that made you young when you were winning
You filled a room with life
When you were drinking
And then I'd hear you say

I've seen things
Things that I hope you will never see ever again

You're like paul newman
Looking at the moon
Your eyes twinkle
Like midnight in the garden of eden
You suffered just south of heaven
But all the things you've done for us
Are long gone now
All is fair in love n' war the question is how?

Heart sinking
To think the man I knew was sent killing
Not all the tales you told were filled with sorrow
You found yourself a girl that gave you tomorrow
The rest is left to us

Now I've seen things
I wouldn't have seen if you hadn't have fought for my days
To my hero
To my hero
You gave us what we know
But now you have to go

To my hero, my hero"
Pop,"I can't forget your face,
the day, the time, the place,
your eyes so full of mistery.

Only a fool thinks twice.
I lost my paradise.
You saw the good in me but I, I looked away.

I let you drive right by
I didn't realize I wanted you 'til you were gone.
I wasted to much time
I learnt that love keeps moving on.
But you're already gone.

(ooh... ooh...)
You're already gone.
(ooh... ooh...)

The one that got away
The one that made you pay.
My karma's catching up with me.

I feel you in my veins.
I won't see you again.
So scared to lose it all, I lost it anyway.

I let you drive right by
I didn't realize I wanted you 'til you were gone.
I wasted to much time
I learnt that love keeps moving on.
But you're already gone.

(oh, oh oh... oh, already gone)
But you're already gone.

You're already gone.

Got me feeling like I can't be without ya'
Anytime someone mentions ya name
I be feeling as if I'm around ya'
Ain't no words to describe you baby
All I know is that you take me high
Can you tell that ya' drive me crazy?
Cause I can't get you outta my mind

Think of ya' when I am going to bed
When I wake up, think of you again
You are my homie, lover, and friend
Exactly why, you light me up inside
Like the 4th of July
Whenever you're around, I always seem to smile
And people ask me how, well you're the reason why
I'm, dancing in the mirror

Singing in the shower
La da de, La da da, La da da
Singing in the shower
La da de, La da da, La da daa
Singing in the shower

All I want, all I need is your loving
Baby you make me hot like an oven
Since you came, you know what I discovered?
Baby I don't need me another
No, No, all I know
Only you got me feeling so
And you know that I got to have ya'
And I don't plan to let you go

Think of ya' when I am going to bed
When I wake up, think of you again
You are my homie, lover, and friend
Exactly why, you light me up inside

There ain't no guarantee
But I take a chance on we
Baby let's take our time
(Singing in the shower)
And when the times get rough
There ain't no giving up, cause it just feels so right
(Singing in the shower)
Don't care what others say
If I got you, I'm straight
You bring my heart to life!

You light me up inside
Like the 4th of July
Whenever you're around, I always seem to smile
And people ask me how, well you're the reason why
I'm, dancing in the mirror

Rock,"I see it around me
I see it in everything
I could be so much more than this

I said my goodbyes
This is my sundown
I'm going to be so much more than this

With one hand high you'll show them your progress
You'll take your time
But no one cares
No one cares
No one cares

I need you to show me the way from crazy
I wanna be so much more than this

With one hand high you'll show them your progress
You'll take your time
But no one cares
No one cares

I wanna be so much more than this)

Good good bye, lovely time
Good good bye, tinsel shine
Good good bye, I'll be fine
Good good bye, good good night"
Rock,"written by Judee Sill 1972 EMI Blackwood Music BMI

Sweet silver angels over the sea
Please come down flying low for me

One time I trusted a stranger
'Cause I heard his sweet song
It was gently enticing me
But there was something wrong
And when I turned
He was gone
Blinding me
His song remains reminding me
He's a bandit and a heartbreaker
My Jesus was a cross maker

Sweet silver angels over the sea
Please come down flying low for me

He wages war with the devil
With a pistol by His side
He's always chasing him out of windows
And He won't give him a place to hide
But he keeps His door
Open wide
Fighting him
He lights a lamp inviting him
He's a bandit and a heartbreaker
My Jesus was a cross maker
Yeah, Jesus was a cross maker

(here's a verse Ms. Sill wrote, which Warren leaves out:
maybe he thought he had enough thunder on this record, already:
I heard the thunder come rumblin'
The light never looked so dim
I see the junction git nearer
and danger is in the wind
And either road's lookin' grim

Hidin' me, I flee, desire dividin' me
He's a bandit and a heartbreaker.
Oh, but Jesus was a cross maker
Yes, Jesus was a cross maker)

Pop,"If you told me that we were through
And our love didn't mean a single thing to you
Would I worry
Would I fret
I'd cry my eyes out with regret

Aha, you bet I would

If you left me for another girl
Do you think I'd ever sit down and cry
Would I worry
Would I fret
I'd cry my eyes out with regret
Little honey
Aha, you bet I would

I don't care if you travel, far away from me
'cause wherever you go, wherever you are
That's where I'm gonna be

If I couldn't hold you all the time
Have you near and know that you were mine
Would I worry
Would I fret
I'd cry my eyes out with regret

Pop,"I'm over thinking love's a fairytale
Been all over the world, to fall and watch it burn
Think it's really time for selfish now
Tired of the hurt, took me so long to learn

Wasn't ready for love
Just wanted somebody to hold me
Now I know I'm enough
I'm better when I put me first
I'm ready to love
But I'm not feeling lonely
'Cause I know I'm enough

Finally I like the view
Spending summer nights with you
I wanna fall into you
Doesn't matter what you do

I'm falling into you, I, I, I
Falling into you, I, I, I
Falling into you, I, I, I
No matter what you do

I don't need you to tell me I'm beautiful
I do it for myself, it's better for my health
I don't need your money for diamond rings
I'm shining by myself, I'm good without your help

Wasn't ready for love
Just wanted somebody to hold me
Now I know I'm enough
I'm better when I put me first
I'm ready to love
But I'm not feeling lonely
'Cause I know I'm enough

Finally I like the view
Spending summer nights with you
I wanna fall into you
Doesn't matter what you do

I'm falling into you, I, I, I
Falling into you, I, I, I

Rock,"The Maids of Elfen-mere
Watch over the boy with chestnut hair
And as he dreams about his love for them
They make a vow to protect him
Spinning their song
Sung by a happy corpse
Foreseeing a pretty girl drawing
Her arrow
But what they want to know
Will she bring him
True love
Or sorrow
The Maids of Elfen-mere
Don't know that the boy with chestnut hair
Winds back the clock at the 11th bell
Hoping to follow them
Through the veil
Spinning their song
Sung by a happy corpse
Foreseeing a pretty girl drawing
Her arrow
But what they want to know
Will the Queen of Eastland or the Wastelands be waking
The Maids of Elfen-mere"
Rock,"Sometimes, I imagine the world without you
But most times, I'm just so happy that I ever found you
It's a complicated web, that you weave inside my head
So much pleasure with such pain
How we always, always stay the same

I'm feelin' the way you cross my mind
And you save me in the nick of time
I'm ridin' the highs, I'm diggin' the lows
'cause at least I feel alive
I've never faced so many emotional days
But my life is good
I'm feelin' you
I'm feelin' you

You go, and then I can finally breathe in
'cause baby I know, in the end you're never leavin'
Well we're rarely ever sane, I drive you crazy and you do the same
But your fire fills my soul
And it wounds me up like no one knows

'cause I'm feelin' the way you cross my mind
And you save me in the nick of time
I'm ridin' the highs, I'm diggin' the lows
'cause at least I feel alive
I've never faced so many emotional days
But my life is good
I'm feelin' you
I'm feelin' you

Rock,"In the wintertime
Keep your feet warm,
Keep your clothes on
And don't forget me.
Keep the memory,
But keep your powder dry, too.

In the summer
By the pool side
While the fireflies
Are all around me,
I'll miss you when I'm lonely,
I'll miss the alimony, too.

Don't forget me, please don't forget me,
Make it easy on me just for a little while.
You know I'll think about you,
Let me know you think about me, too.

When we're older
And full of cancer
It doesn't matter now,
Come on, get happy,
'Cause nothing lasts forever,
And I will always love you.

Don't forget me, please don't forget me,
Make it easy on me just for a little while.
You know I'll think about you,
Let me know you think about me, too.

You know I'll think about you,
Let me know you think about me, too.

Pop,"With a little bit of work
And a little bit of conversation
With a head full of hope
And a bit of your self belief

Rely on your imagination
Am I asking too much
To remain in your company
Stop everything

We can stay here if you hold still
We can stay here for life if you say you will
We'll be caught in a moment of time
If we all freeze
Don't even breathe
Everyone freeze
Then you won't leave
Freeze

With the flicker of a promise
And in view of our situation
I think you should know
That I never wanted this to change
And you're free to say whatever you want to
But whatever you want, whatever you want
Don't change
Please don't change

We can stay here if you hold still
We can stay here for life if you say you will
We'll be caught in a moment of time
If we all freeze
Don't even breathe
Everyone freeze
Then you won't leave

The words, the words we never say
Don't make a sound till it's too late
Just freeze so we don't have to start again
Before we make the same mistakes
Before we throw it all away
The words, the words we never say
Don't make a sound till it's too late
Just freeze so we don't have to start again
Before we make the same mistakes
Before we throw it all away

Just freeze
Don't even breathe
Everyone freeze
Then you won't leave
Everyone freeze"
Rock,"There's a picture in the hall, I know
And it's from a time when feelings showed
Though I hold it close before my eyes
My heart refuses to see

Loving you could have been, oh so easy
But there is something you don't understand
Through the times when two were one completely
There was another in this well laid plan

This corridor seems to stretch for years ahead
But patient hearts cannot match times steady tread
Is this the threshold of a fantasy?
Is there still life at all?

Loving you could have been, oh so easy
But there is something you don't understand
Through the times when two were one completely
There was another in this well laid plan
Best laid plan of ours

Watering the garden, some comfort for the twilight years
Still, life never lingers, it marches past our veil of tears
A moment's all we've got, to have and to hold
Don't slip, don't blink, don't turn your head

With a photographic memory
I could live in a time that used to be
Is this the threshold of a fantasy?
Is there still life at all?

Loving you could have been, oh so easy
But there is something you don't understand
Through the times when I was won completely
There was another in this well laid plan

Loving you could have been, oh so easy
But there is something you don't understand
There was a time when I was won completely
Our emotions they got out of hand

"
Pop,"Locked in, shut out
Dark skies crashing down
Hanging by a thread
Without you I'm lost in my head

I don't need the world to love me
I just need to do what's right for me

Baby, I'm missing you
I'm one breath away, it's almost too late
Baby, I'm missing you
And all that remains is my broken faith

Missing you
Missing you
And I'm missing me too
And I'm missing me too

They ask ""what's wrong? ""
In their eyes they know I'm gone
No words come out
In my mind I'm crying out

I don't need the world to love me
I just need to do what's right for me

Baby, I'm missing you
I'm one breath away, it's almost too late
Baby, I'm missing you
And all that remains is my broken faith

Missing you
Missing you
And I'm missing me too
And I'm missing me too, yeah
And I'm missing me too
Missing you baby, missing you baby

Baby, I'm missing you
I'm one breath away, it's almost too late
Baby, I'm missing you
And all that remains is my broken faith
Baby, I'm missing you
I'm one breath away, it's almost too late
Baby, I'm missing you
And all that remains is my broken faith

I'm missing you
(I'm missing you, missing you babe)
I'm missing you
(I'm missing you, missing you babe)
And I'm missing me too"
Pop,"(Camila)
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy
They pour

(Ally)
When I'm thinkin' 'bout you (oh, no, no, noo)
I've been thinkin' 'bout ya (you know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout ya
Do you think about me still? (do ya, do ya?)

(Dinah)
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, oooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, oooh

(Lauren)
No, I don't like you
I just thought you were cool
Enough to kick it
Got a beach house
I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you
I just thought you were cute
That's why I kiss you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it
Though I'm lyin' down

(Normani)
Thinkin' 'bout you (Ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
(You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?

'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, oooh"
Rock,"I been watchin' you a long time
Trying to figure out where and when
We been moving down that same line
The time is now maybe we could get skin to skin

Don't know when this chance might come again
Good times got a way of comin' to an end
Don't know when this chance might come again
Good times got a way of slippin' a-way
Let's be friends, baby let's be friends

I know we're different you and me
Get a diffente way of walkin'
The time has come te let the past be history
Yeah, if we could just start talkin'

Don't know when this chance might come again
Good times got a way of comin' to an end
Don't know when this chance might come again
Good times got a way of slippin' a-way
Let's be friends, baby let's be friends

Do, do do doo do do do doo...

There's a lot of talk going `round now
Let'em talk you know you're the only one
There's a lot of walls need tearing down
Together we could take them down one by one

Chorus

Rock,"Had to be, don't look back, you're older
Take it from me
The love you have is stronger

And in your eyes I see myself
I want from you what you want of me
And you know
The love you have is stronger

It had to be, don't look back, you're older
Ahhhhh, ahhhhh

[guitar solo (Pete Ham)]

And in your eyes I see myself
I want from you what you want of me
And you know."
Pop,"Heard you had another long day
I wanna hear about it, baby
Tonight we're doing things my way
I got some place I wanna take, ya

Now I see how you go all the way
To make me so pleased
You're the one I want by me

So let's joyride
We can do anything you've been wanting to do
Cause it's your night
What you say about trying something brand new?
Don't you tell me we should slow it down
Let me take you all the way around
So let's joyride, so let's joyride
Baby let's ride

Baby let's ride
Oh yeah
Baby let's ride

Had another one of those nights
I know things can get crazy
And you're in need of a good time
So I'll be sure not to waste it

Now I see how you go all the way
To make me so pleased
You're the only one I need

So let's joyride
We can do anything you've been wanting to do
Cause it's your night
What you say about trying something brand new?
Don't you tell me we should slow it down
Let me take you all the way around
So let's joyride, so let's joyride
Baby let's ride

Baby let's ride
Baby let's ride

Don't stress, don't stress
It's alright baby you're alright
Just leave all those worries behind
So let's joyride
We can do anything

Woah
Said let's ride
Woah
Baby, let's ride"
Rock,"I've been traveling over mountains
Even through the valleys, too
I've been traveling night and day
I've been running all the way
Baby, trying to get to you.

Ever since I read your letter
Where you said you loved me true
I've been traveling night and day
I've been running all the way
baby, trying to get to you

When I read your loving letter
Then my heart began to sing
There were many miles between us,
But they didn't mean a thing.

I just had to reach you, baby,
In spite of all that I've been through.
I kept traveling night and day,
I kept running all the way,
Baby, trying to get to you.

Well if I had to do it over
That's exactly what I'd do,
I would travel night and day,
And I'd still run all the way,
Baby, trying to get to you.

Well, there's nothing that could hold me
Or that could keep me away from you
When your loving letter told me
That you really loved me true

Lord above me knows I love you
It was He who brought me through,
When my way was darkest night,
He would shine His brightest light,
When I was trying to get to you."
Rock,"If you don’t want to smile again
You will cry until the end
Cause I know where you’re bound
With the sorrow that brings you down
So now I beg of you
Tell me what I can do
To make you smile again
Cause I let you down my friend

Now you’re on your own
In a life with your best friend gone
And it ain’t easy to be
In a world of misery
So now I beg…
Tell me what I can do
To make you smile again
Cause I let you down my friend

Your sorrow like rain comes down
In the tears that you shed
Now our love is gone
And your roses are dead
Your sorrow like rain comes down
Your sorrow like rain comes down

Cause I know I let you go
And I’ll always regret it
Cause I let you down my friend
But I’ll never let you down again

Your sorrow like rain comes down
In the tears that you shed
Now our love is gone
And your roses are dead
Your sorrow like rain comes down
Your sorrow like rain comes down

Cause I know I let you go
I’ll always regret it
Cause I let you down my friend
I’ll never let you down again
I’ll never let you down again
I’ll never let you down again
I’ll never let you down again
I’ll never let you down again
I’ll never let you down again"
Rock,"There is a house in New Orleans
They call it The Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many other poor boys
And god, I know, I'm one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

And the only thing a gambler needs is
A suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he'll be satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Oh mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the house of the rising sun

Well I've got one foot on the platform
And the other foot on the train
I am going Back to New Orleans
to wear that ball and chain

There is a house in New Orleans
They call The Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many other poor boys
And god, I know, I'm one"
Rock,"Every little thing you do is magic lately
Every single thing that you do is cool
Every little thing you do is tragically hip
Even when you tend to play the fool

When you open up your tired eyes
And take a look at what?s inside
The mirror on your wall tells you the truth
You?re exactly where you wanna be
There is no room for streams of tears
The sun is shining down, the clouds have cleared

Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one

Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one

Every single thing you do is magic baby
Every little thing that you do is cool
Every little thing you do is fashionably hip
Even when you?re mixing greens with blues

When you open up your pain stained eyes
From the night before when you were high
The smile upon your face tells you the truth
You?re exactly where you wanna be
There ain't no fear of misery
The sun is shining down, the clouds have cleared

Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one

Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one, oohhh....

(Could you be the one for me)
(Could you be the one for me)
(Could you be the one for me)
(Could you be the one)

Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one"
Pop,"I hear a voice, hear a voice that I recognize
Pulling me closer
Your every word, every word that I hear tonight
It's winning me over

There's no use running, what we got coming
You don't have to be afraid
We're standing on, standing on, on the edge of grey

It starts with a whisper
Then a heartbeat
The world is way inside
Till you got me, you're all I hear tonight

It's getting louder and louder
One voice at a time
Then you softly start to blow my mind
Can't stop the whisper
Can't stop the whisper
The whisper it's never been so loud

You hit the note
Strike a chord like a symphony
Taking me over
Cause you're the one, you're the one
Who can light that spark
Blow it all open

It's just one reason for what I'm feeling
I can only hear the truth
Call me now, call me now
Yeah, it was always you

It starts with a whisper
Then a heartbeat
The world is way inside
Till you got me, you're all I hear tonight

It's getting louder and louder
One voice at a time
Then you softly start to blow my mind
Can't stop the whisper
Can't stop the whisper
The whisper
Cause we can't seem to stop
Can't seem to stop
Cause we're shouting it out, shouting it out
Can't stop the whisper, the whisper
It's never been so loud, so loud
It's never been so loud, so loud
The whisper, the whisper
The whisper, the whisper

Can't stop the whisper
Can't stop the whisper
The whisper
Cause we can't seem to stop
Can't seem to stop
Cause we're shouting it out, shouting it out
Can't stop the whisper, the whisper
It's never been so loud, so loud
It's never been so loud, so loud"
Pop,"Well, it's not far down to paradise
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find tranquility

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

It's not far to never-never land
No reason to pretend
And if the wind is right you can find the joy
Of innocence again

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free

Fantasy, it gets the best of me
When I'm sailing
All caught up in the reverie
Every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me?

Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free

Well it's not far back to sanity
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find serenity

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free"
Rock,"(Reed)

If I could be anything in the world that flew
I would be a bat and come swooping after you
And if the last time you were here things were a bit askew

Well you know what happens after dark
When rattlesnakes lose their skins and their hearts
And all the missionaries lose their bark
Oh, all the trees are calling after you
And all the venom snipers after you
Are all the mountains bolder after you?

If I could be anyone of the things in this world that bite
Instead of an ocelot on a leash, I'd rather be a kite
And be tied to the end of your string
And flying in the air, babe, at night
Cause ou know what they say about honey bears
When you shave off all their baby hair
You have a hairy minded pink bare bear

And all the balls are rolling out for you
And stones are all erupting out for you
And all the cheap bloodsuckers are flying after you

Yesterday, Daisy Mae and Biff were grooving on the street
And just like in a movie, her hands became her feet
Her belly button was her mouth
Wich meant she tasted what she'd speak

But the funny thing is what happened to her nose
It grew until it reached all of her toes
Now when people say her feet they mean her nose

And curtains laced with diamonds dear for you
And all the Roman Noblemen for you
And kingdom's Christian Soldiers dear for you
And melting ice cap mountain tops for you
And knights in flamming silver robes for you
And bats that with a kiss turn prince for you
Swoop, Swoop
oh baby,
Rock Rock
Swoop, Swoop, Rock, Rock

Dry your eyes my little friend
Let me take you by the hand

When Johnny strikes up the band

They'll be rocking in the projects
Walking down along the strand
Freddie get ready Rock steady
When Johnny strikes up the band
Johnny strikes up the band
When Johnny strikes up the ...
When Johnny strikes up the ...
When Johnny strikes up the band

And Johnny is my main man
He's the keeper of the keys
He'll put your mind at ease
He's guaranteed to please
Back by popular demand

Look around, my little friend
Jubilation in the land
Freddie get ready Rock steady
When Johnny strikes up the band

Pop,"I feel so bad
Never felt like this, about anything, I never have, no
Please, don't tell me that
What's lost is lost, it's never gonna come back home

I walk in circles when there's no one around
Try to fight my own direction
I test water but it burns my hand
As I disfigure my reflection

I've been a good girl
But you let me down

I feel so bad
Never felt like this 'bout anything, I never have, no
Please, don't tell me that
What's lost is lost, it's never gonna come back home

I lie in silence and I just can't sleep
How I long for your affection
My eyes are tired and my body is weak
I can't handle this rejection

And I think it's mean
How you let me down

I feel so bad
Never felt like this 'bout anything, I never have, no
Please, don't tell me that
What's meant to be is meant to be, it's no consolation

I'll carry on
Proving everyone wrong
I will succeed

I feel so bad
Never felt like this 'bout anything, I never have, no
Please, don't tell me that
What's lost is lost, it's never gonna come back home, no

I feel so bad (I lie in silence and I just cannot sleep)
Never felt like this 'bout anything, I never have, no
Please, don't tell me that (my eyes are tired and my body is weak)
What's meant to be is meant to be, it's no consolation"
Rock,"I've been here before
On the street of hearts
Tryin' to find my way
To be close to you

Takin' careful steps
Makin' some mistakes
Now it's judgement day
But all along I knew

Could this one be magic
Tell me what the rumours say
Now the whispers started
There's no turning back

You move heaven for me
You bring heaven down to earth
When I see the love that's shining in your eyes
You move heaven for me
You bring heaven down to earth
And I'm thankful there's a place in heavens sky
I can hear you breathing
Loving heart and healing hands

On a solo flight
Sent from heavens door
Hear you call my name
When love came first

To be where you are
Like a shooting star
Tryin' to chase the flame
From heaven down to earth

Runnin' in slow motion
Tryin' to find a place to hide
I guess there's no escapin'
Time to face the facts

You move heaven for me
You bring heaven down to earth
When I see the love that's shining in your eyes
You move heaven for me
You bring heaven down to earth
Now I'm flyin' so high.

I've heard that heaven must be missing an angel
Don't care what the story's worth
All I care is that you're here beside me
My angel - here on earth.

Solo

I can hear you breathing
Loving heart and healing hands

You move heaven for me
You bring heaven down to earth
When I see the love that's shining in your eyes
You move heaven for me
You bring heaven down to earth
And I'm thankful there's aplace in heavens sky

Repeat 'til fade"
Rock,"Gypsy Biker

The speculators made their money on the blood you shed
Your momma's pulled the sheets up off your bed
Profiteers on Jhames Street sold your shoes and clothes
Ain't nobody talkin' because everybody knows
We pulled your cycle up back the garage and polished up the chrome*
Our gypsy biker coming home

Sister Mary sits with your colors, but Johnny's drunk and gone
This old town's been rousted, which side you on?
They would march up over the hill, this old fools parade
Shouting victory for the righteous for you must hear the grace
Ain't nobody talkin', but just waiting on the phone
Gypsy biker coming home

Whoa!

[Guitar solo]

We rode into the foothills, Bobby brought the gasoline
We stood around the circle as she lit up the ravine
The spring hot desert wind rushed down on us all the way back home

[Harmonica bridge]

To the dead, well it don't matter much 'bout who's wrong or right
You asked me that question, I didn't get it right
You slipped into your darkness, now all that remains
Is my love for you brother, life's still unchanged
To him that threw you away, you ain't nothing but gone
My gypsy biker's coming home

And now I'm out countin' white lines
Countin' white lines and getting stoned
My gypsy biker's coming home

Whoa!

Keep me cool
Going mad
Don't know what to do
Do I need a friend?
Well, I need one now

All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you

All I've done
I've done for me
All you gave
You gave for free
I gave nothing in return
And there's little left of me

All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you

In red-eyed pain I'm knocking on your door again
My crazy brain in tangles
Pleading for your gentle voice
Those storms keep pounding through my head and heart
I pray you'll soothe my sorry soul

All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you

All the days of my life
All the days of my life

Pop,"Taste the poison from your lips
Lately we're as good as gone
Oh, our love is drunk and is
Singing me my favorite song

Me and you
We were meant to break
I know that it's true
But it's much too late

You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard to leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
You're perfectly wrong for me
All the stars in the sky can see
Why you're perfectly wrong for me

Oh, you know how much it hurts
Every time you say you hate me
But when we're making love, you make it worth it
Can't believe the places that you take me

There's no use
We were meant to break
I know that it's truth
And it's much too late

You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard to leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Oh, you're perfectly wrong for me
All the stars in the sky can see
Why you're perfectly wrong for me

Oh and why can't I quit
When you break my heart open
I need you more than I know
Oh and I can't resist
When you're up against my skin
I never wanted let you go

You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, mhm
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Yeah, but you know that I won't leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, oh

Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard for me

Rock,"The stock is empty
in our eyeball store
All we got left
a few cataracts and sores
The faggot mimic machine
never had ideas
Mission impossible
they self destruct on fear

On a standard New York night
ghouls go to see their so called stars
A fairly stupid thing
to pay 5 bucks for a 4th rate imitators

They say, I'm so empty
no surface, no depth
Oh, please, can I be you
your personality's so great
Like new buildings
square tall and the same
Sorry, Miss Stupid
didn't you know it was a game
I'm just waiting
for them to hurry up and die
It's really getting to crowed here
help me New York stars

Contributions accepted all the same
We need new people store
remember, we're very good at games

Rock,"In my time of sorrow,
In my time of feeling bad
Oh what I'd give
Just to relive
All of the good times that I've had.

In my time of sorrow
In my time of feeling alone
There was a time
I could ease my mind
With thoughts of just being on my own.

Changes of life
I'm going through
Keep me from doing
What I know I should do.

In my time of sorrow
In my time where teardrops fall
I can't tell you why
I don't want to try,
But the time has come
For me to say fare well.

In my time of sorrow
In my time of sorrow
"
Rock,"When the time gets right
I'm gonna pick you up
And take you far way from trouble my love
Under a big ol' sky
Out in a field of green
There's gotta be something left for us to believe

Oh, I await the day
Good fortune comes our way
And we ride down the Kings Highway

No you can't hide out
In a six gun town
We wanna hold our heads up, but we gotta stay down
I don't wanna end up
In a room all alone
Don't wanna end up someone that I don't even know

Lover, I await the day
Good fortune comes our way
And we ride down the Kings Highway"
Pop,"Here I am, stuck on this couch
Scrolling through my notes
Heart was broken, still not growing, nah

Waking up to headlines
Filled with devastation again
My heart is broken
But I keep going

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside
Now, I know it
Yeah, I know it

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away

It's hard to sleep at night
Knowing what's outside
Feeling hopeless
I need focus

You hit me with words
I never heard come out your mouth
To be honest
I don't want it, no

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
(youth away)

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away"
Rock,"On my way home I met an
Old friend of mine
We walked and we talked an' shared
A bottle of wine
We started to dance,
my intentions were good
How could I know I'd be misunderstood

I promised to call before the weekend
Was thru
We'd all get together so she could
meet you
I was just being friendly, I met her
By chance
You gotta believe me - it's not a romance

Don't turn the light out, I'm starting to see
Don't turn the light out, you're getting to me
Don't turn the light out, we're burning so bright
Don't turn the light out.....don't turn out the light

You gotta see it from my point
Of view
The same situation could
Happen to you
I said it was over before she left
Town
I can't believe that you're putting me down


Aaahh, It would be easy if you'd lighten up
Do it to please me, enough is enough
All that we've been thru, how can you doubt
The ups an' the downs are what loving's about

Don't turn the light out, I'm starting to see
Don't turn the light out, you're getting to me
Don't turn the light out, we're burning so bright
Don't turn the light out.....don't turn out the light

Mmm, don't turn the light out
ooohhh, don't turn the light out

Don't turn the light out, I'm starting to see
Don't turn the light out, you're getting to me
Don't turn the light out, we're burning so bright
Don't turn the light out.....don't turn out the light"
Pop,"Now that you're older and girl I'm older too (yeah yeah)
Baby I'll still have those feelings, those feelings for you
'cos you are all that matters to me
You're all that matters (all that matters to love)
You're all that matters to love
(all that matters to me without your love where would I be?)
Where would I be? where would I be?
Girl can't you see, I'm so close to surrender
This lady has changed, from the girl I remember
Now you're all that I could ever dream and more
This is a lifetime of love I'm so sure
'cos you are all that matters to me
You are all that matters to love
You are all that matters to me
Without your love where would I be
Baby I found mm, a dream that's making me stronger
(making me stronger)
I've looked and I've realised, that noone's taking me from ya
Now you gave me more than all my dreams come true
Where would I be now baby without you?

Now you are all that I could ever dream and more
And baby you know that this is a life time of love I'm sure
Life time of love
You know that baby it's a life time
(baby it's a life time) of love, it's a life time of love"
Pop,"Everybody’s got a fantasy
Part of being where you are
For every action there’s a price to pay
So am i paying for it now?

See what i mean?
But i can see it
Keep on holding onto me
This is how it’s meant to be

Ref.
Take me with you
Take my heart and let it pay
Take me with you
I got no one else to say

It feels like i’m dying
When you walk away
Take me with you
Take! me! with! you!

I’m not so mad about that (accident?)
I’d really love some time to change
But i can’t stand to feel that pain of love
I guess i got myself to blame

See i need to breathe?
To make me feel the way
My body doesn’t need
The warmth of your (greed?)

Ref.

This is to the side i’ve cried upon
Do you think that you can put this all behind you?
We’ll never go back to the way it was
Maybe i’m still holding on
To a part of you that’s gone
And now it’s time to move on
Then take me with you!!!

Ref x 2."
Rock,"I want someone who lives up to this grandeur in my head
And you don't do much to sell me I'd be best with you instead
I hate the way I feel, but I don't think I can change
I just breathe you each day

Are we only damaging the little we have left?
Both of us swimming in the same polluted mess
Are we too damaged now to possibly connect?
To honestly connect?

A lot of time's been wasted putting off doing the work
If we both step up to own it then I'll take what's coming first
Of everything you say, it's the truth that really hurts
But how could that be worse?

Are we only damaging the little we have left?
Both of us swimming in the same polluted mess
Are we too damaged now to possibly connect?
To ever reconnect?

I'll say when I'm ready
You'll know when I'm ready
When I'm ready
(are we only damaging, damaging)

Are we only damaging the little we have left?
Both of us swimming in the same polluted mess
Are we too damaged now to possibly connect?
To honestly connect?"
Pop,"Lately I see clouds of sorrow in your eyes
Some deep sadness you can never quite disguise
Now I'm scared to ask what it's leading to
But I'm more afraid of not asking you
Is there something that you want to tell me
Is there something that I ought to know
Are we something that's still worth fighting for
Or should I simply let you go
Is there something I can do to reach you
Are we something more than history
I'll find some way to convince you to stay
If you just tell me honestly
Is there something left of you and me
You've got secrets you've been keeping for too long
And I'm going crazy acting like there's nothing wrong
I can taste the truth every time we kiss
And I can't go on
At least not like this
I don't want to lose you
But what's the use of holding on
I don't really have you
If the feeling's gone
Is there something I can do to reach you
Are we something more than history
If there's no way to convince you to stay
And be the way we used to be
Then there's something that I want to tell you
And I want you to believe it's true
We had something that I'll never forget
Even if I wanted to
'Cause part of me will always be with you
"
Pop,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen

I dont wanna fight, I would rather kiss you
Come into this room and let me show you have much I miss you
What I gotta do? to show you that I need you
Baby im back, do whatever you want me to

Please spend the night
I wanna make this right
Girl what you leavin' for? (leaving' for)
Shawty close the door
We 'otta be making love
Instead of breaking up
Come on baby let me show you I'm for real(lay in my bed)
We 'otta be making love
Instead of breaking up
Come on baby let me show you im for real(lay in my bed)

Listen, remeber when I said I will never hurt you?
You aint gotta cry, I know all the things you been threw
Baby I aint into satisfying no body but you
Touching on no body but you
Every thing im saying is true

Please spend the night
I wanna make this right
So what you leavin' for? (leaving' for)
Shawty close the door
We 'otta be making love

Rock,"I can't get to sleep
I think about the implications
Of diving in too deep
And possibly the complications

Especially at night
I worry over situations
I know will be alright
Perhaps its just imagination

Day after day it reappears
Night after night my heartbeat, shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away

Alone between the sheets
Only brings the exasperation
It's time to walk the streets
Smell the desperation

At least there's pretty lights
And though there's little variation
It nullifies the night
From overkill

Day after day it reappears
Night after night my heartbeat, shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away
Come back another day

I can't get to sleep
I think about the implications
Of diving in too deep
And possibly the complications

Especially at night
I worry over situations
I know will be alright
It's just overkill

Day after day it reappears
Night after night my heartbeat, shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away
Ghosts appear and fade away
Ghosts appear and fade away"
Rock,"She grew up in an Indiana town,
Had a good-lookin' mama who never was around.
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights.

Well, she moved down here at the age of eighteen.
She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen.
I was introduced and we both started groovin'.
I said, ""I dig you baby, but I got to keep movin' on.
Keep movin' on.""

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain.
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again.

Well, I don't know, but I've been told,
You never slow down, you never grow old.
I'm tired of screwin' up, tired of going down,
Tired of myself, tired of this town.

Oh, my, my. Oh, hell, yes.
Honey, put on that party dress.
Buy me a drink, sing me a song.
Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long.

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain.
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again.

There's pigeons down on Market Square.
She's standin' in her underwear,
Lookin' down from a hotel room.
Nightfall will be comin' soon.

Oh, my, my. Oh, hell, yes.
You got to put on that party dress.
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone.
I hit my last number and walked to the road.

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain.
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again.
"
Rock,"Sunrise, sundown
the streets gone golden brown
Auburn skies above
I'm searching for my love
I'm searching for my love

There goes my miracle walking away, walking away
There goes my miracle walking away, walking away

Moonlight, moon bright
where's my lucky star tonight
Streets lost in lamp light
Then suddenly inside
Suddenly inside

There goes my miracle walking away, walking away
There goes my miracle walking away, walking away

Look what you've done
Look what you've done
Look what you've done

Look what you've done
Look what you've done
Look what you've done

Look what we've done
Look what we've done
Look what we've done

Heartache, heartbreak
Love gives, love takes
The book of love holds its rules
Disobeyed by fools
Disobeyed by fools

There goes my miracle walking away, walking away
There goes my miracle walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away
There goes my miracle

Sunrise, sundown"
Pop,"Here I come, the king of clowns
As I hide behind this smile and paint the town
Though I cry since you're gone
You'll never know because the show must go on

I've been sad (I've been sad) I've been blue (I've been blue)
Ever since the day that you found someone new (someone new)
I pretend but you can't tell
With my broken heart I play my part so well

Step aside, here I come, the king of clowns
As I hide the lonely teardrops that come down
I make believe with a smile
But the king of clowns is crying all the while

Tra-la-la-la-la-la-li-lo
Tra-la-la-la-la-la-li-lo
Here comes the king of clowns
Tra-la-la-la-la-la-li-lo
Tra-la-la-la-la-la-li-lo
Here comes the king of clowns

There are tears (there are tears) you'll never see (never see)
No you'll never see my tears and pity me (pity me)
Though I'm hurt, still I'm proud
Always laughing as I walk among the crowd

Step aside, here I come, the king of clowns
As I hide the lonely teardrops that come down
I make believe with a smile
But the king of clowns is crying all the while

Tra-la-la-la-la-la-li-lo

Pop,"My sweet one
My sad-eyed little lover
My sweet one
I swear there are no others
But you, but you, but you, but you, but you

Baby
At night-time
Only sometime
I get kind of lonely
And this old roaming heart of mine
It starts searching on its own, and
I swear my love is true
And I give it all to you
Baby

Well those sweet sad eyes
Don't you know they call me back
Everytime
I try to go astray
And the image of you
Don't you know it always lingers on my mind
Every minute of the day

My sweet one
My sad-eyed little lover
My sweet one
I swear there are no others
But you, but you, but you, but you, but you

Baby
Well those sweet sad eyes
Don't you know they call me back
Everytime
I try to go astray
And the image of you
Don't you know it always lingers on my mind
Every minute of the day

My sad-eyed little lover
My sweet one

But you, but you, but you, but you, but you

Rock,"Are you gonna live your life wonderin
standing in the back lookin around?
Are you gonna waste your time thinkin'
how youve grown up or how you missed out?
Things are never gonna be the way you want.
Where's it gonna get you acting serious?
Things are never gonna be quite what you want.
Or even at 25, you gotta start sometime.
Im on my feet
Im on the floor
m good to go.
Now all I need is just to hear a song I know.
I wanna always feel like part of this was mine.
I wanna fall in love tonight.
Are you gonna live your life
standing in the back looking around?
Are you gonna waste your time?
Gotta make a move or you'll miss out.
Someone's gonna ask you what its all about.
Stick around nostalgia won't let you down.
Someone's gonna ask you what its all about.
What are gonna have to say for yourself?
Im on my feet
Im on the floor
Im good to go.
Now all I need is just to hear a song I know.
I wanna always feel like part of this was mine.
I wanna fall in love tonight.
Crimson and clover, over and over.
Crimson and clover, over and over.
Our house in the middle of the street
why did we ever meet?
Started my rock 'n roll fantasy.
Don't don't, don't let's start
why did we ever part?
Kick start my rock 'n rollen heart.
Im on my feet
Im on the floor
Im good to go.
So come on Davey
sing me somethin that I know.
I wanna always feel like part of this was mine.
I wanna fall in love tonight.
Here tonight.
I wanna always feel like part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight
"
Pop,"Some nights, i wake up cashing in my bad luck; some nights, i call it a draw
Some nights, i wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, i wish they'd just fall off

But i still wake up, i still see your ghost
Oh lord, i'm still not sure what i stand for, oh
What do i stand for? what do i stand for?
Most nights, i don't know anymore

This is it, girls, this is war - what are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype - save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and i'm half as liked,
But here they come again to jack my style

And that's alright; i found a martyr in my bed tonight
He kiss my bones from wondering just who i am, who i am, who i am
Oh, who am i? oh

Some nights, i wish that this all would end
Cause i could use some friends for a change
And some nights, i'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, i always win, i always win...

But i still wake up, i still see your ghost
Oh lord, im still not sure what i stand for
What do i stand for? what do i stand for?
Most nights, i don't know, (oh come on)

So this is it? i sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?

No. when i see stars, when i see stars, that's all they are
When i hear songs, they sound like a swan, so come on
Oh, come on. oh, come on. oh, come on!

That is it, guys, that is all - five minutes in and i'm bored again
Ten years of this, i'm not sure if anybody understands
This is not one for the folks back home; i'm sorry to leave, mom, i had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breaking for my sister and the con that she called ""love""
But when i look into my nephews eyes...
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things they can come from...
Some terrible lies.

The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream i just had about you and me
I called you up, but we'd both agree it's for the best you don't listen
It's for the best we get our distance"
Rock,"You make do with your lot, you gotta choice to make
You gotta follow your gut, your head’s in a state
You’re stuck in a rut, you’re wasting days
Time don’t wait so…
Make your choice, either go or stay
What you got in your heart is dying every day
You’re scared to let go, though your mind is made
Just pack your soul and don’t stay

You’re feeling down and low
You’re dreaming, of how it should feel
Staying will set your soul on fire

You’re stuck in a rut and your life is forgotten

So it’s only a house, don’t make it a home
Are you a man or a mouse, you gotta walk it alone
It’s time to let go, get on with the show
The clock is ticking
What you’ve got is long gone, draw a line in the sand
You’re poker face is shot, I can see through your hand
Stop lying to yourself, gotta make new plans
Time don’t wait for no man

You’re feeling down and low
You’re dreaming, of how it should feel
Staying will set your soul on fire

You’re stuck in a rut and your life is forgotten"
Rock,"Rainy days will save my life
Rainy days and rainy nights
Move me closer and hold me tight
It's been raining my whole life
It's been raining my whole life
And I can see what I'm like
[???]
But the rain it comes, and I'm the one I'm thinking of



Passerby don't bother me
One plus one plus nobody
Heartless poor old worker bee
All my life I've hated things
All my life I've hated things
And I'm am so cruel and kind
[???]
And the rain it comes, and I'm the one it's thinking of



Rainy days will save my life
Rainy days and rainy nights
Move me closer and hold me tight
It's been raining my whole life
It's been raining my whole life
And I can see what I'm like

But the rain it comes, and I'm the one I'm thinking of"
Rock,"Mara Lisa waves her hand at the car
With a stick and a rose-colored shawl
Fighting of tears of a dull and a deafening pain
They'll repay every senseless act
They ever borrowed from you
Oh, just wait and you will see, won't you, Mara Lisa?

Through the curtains, sees the town and the parades
Oh, you know how innocence fades, don't you, Mara Lisa?

Marching softly through the weeds in her front yard
Up onto the porch to a sip of tea
Wounded soldier with a cane and a bitter remedy
You'll repay every trick you pulled
On the boys that were lost out at sea
Oh they drowned in your memory, didn't they, Mara Lisa?
You'll repay every senseless act
To the boys who were dead in the field
Oh you know they're were already killed, don't you, Mara Lisa?

Through the curtains, sees the town and the parades
Oh, you know how innocence fades, don't you, Mara Lisa?

Were you even capable of love?
If you were, then how do you know
Innocence keeps tabs on the ones it can't see
It wet it's lips, and it said ""Mara Lisa""

Marching softly through the weeds in her front yard
Up onto the porch to a sip of tea
Wounded woman with a cane and a bitter remedy
You'll repay every trick you pulled
To the boys that were lost out in the field"
Rock,"If I were a carpenter and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway, would you have my baby?
If a tinker were my trade, would you still love me?
Carrying the pots I made, following behind me

Save my love through loneliness
Save my love for sorrow
I've given you my onliness
Come and give me your tomorrows

If I worked my hands in wood, would you still love me
Answer me, babe, yes, I would, I'd put you above me
If I were a miller at a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your colored box, your soft shoes shining?"
Pop,"So you make a little money
Off of somebody else's sweat
So some people starve a little
While you get fat
While you get fat

So you grind and grind
And you push and shove
And claim that those most worthy
Will get what they deserve
What they deserve

It can't be true
It can't be true
Because I've seen too many hungry faces
I've seen too many with the likes of you
It can't be true

For you everything has it's price
You give nothing away for free
If silence were truly golden
I guess no one could sleep
No one could sleep

You have money at your fingertips
People at your beck and call
And you're fool enough
To think for a price
You can have the whole wide world

For all our sake's
And all our lives
We must hope the words
That come from your lips
We must hope those words are lies

For all our sake's
And all our lives
We must hope the dreams
Soulless visions that you have
Are never realized

So
You've got a big house
And you drive a fancy car
So what if your pockets are full
If you have an empty heart

You snap your fingers
And all the waters part
So what if the people bow down
If they show you no regard

Your left hand
Always watches your right
So what if you trust in God
If you can't sleep at night

You think you've made it
You think you've got what everyone wants
So what if you're a big fat man
With an empty little heart

Who has made a little money
Off of somebody else's sweat
Who watched the people starve
While you got fat
While you got fat
You got fat
You got fat"
Rock,"Can you see the view? Can you feel the heat?
I'm savin' no time for you, no time for me
You're up on the news, I'm wild in the streets
I'm under the lights, tonight I won't have to hide the need
But you got love in its place
In its own time and space
You got love in its place in your
Little Paradise

You got fashion secure in your own little world
Diamonds are forever for Hollywood girls
No need to cover, no reason to lie
Life without your Maserati is grounds for suicide

But you got love in its place
In its own time and space
You got love in its place in your
Little Paradise
Little Paradise

You got love in its place
In its own time and space
You got love in its place in your

You got love in its place
In its own time and space
You got love in its place in your

Little Paradise
Little Paradise
Little Paradise
Little Paradise
Little Paradise
Little Paradise
Little Paradise

Rock,"I was thinking of things that I hate to do
SEX WITH YOUR PARENTS
Things you do to me or I do to you, baby
SEX WITH YOUR PARENTS

Something fatter or uglier than Rush Rambo
Something more disgusting than Robert Dole
Something pink that climbs out of a hole
And there it was - SEX WITH YOUR PARENTS

I was getting so sick of this right wing republican shit
These ugly old man scared of young tit and dick
So I try to think of something that made me sick
And there it was - SEX WITH YOUR PARENTS

Now these old fucks can steal all they want
And they can go and pass laws saying you can't say what you want
And you can't look at this and you can't look at that
And you can't smoke this and you can't snort that
And me baby - I got statistics - I got stats
These people have been to bed with their parents

Now I know you're shocked but hang and have a brew
If you think about it for a minute you know that it's true
They're ashamed and repelled and they don't know what to do
They've had sex with their parents
When they looked into their lovers eyes they saw - mom
In the name of the family values we must ask whose family
In the name of the family values we must ask - Senator

It's has been reported that you have had
Illegal congress with your mother, - SEX WITH YOUR PARENTS
ah, Senator
An illegal congress by proxy is a
Pigeon by any other name, - SEX WITH YOUR PARENTS

Senators you polish a turd
Here in the big city we got a word
For those who would bed their beloved big bird
And make a mockery of our freedoms
Ah, without even using a condom
Without even saying ""no""
By god we have a name for people like that
It's - hey motherfucker

"
Pop,"Straight up from the heart, you re my number one
And hey here s the part, I m still having fun
It s like you re the cloud underneath my feet
And you re the reason that I breathe

Because you blow my mind
And the way you re talking baby you re so cool
I do anything for you

Hey babe ravish me love me till it hurts
don't you dare to leave, button down my skirt
kiss me quick I'm about to burst
patience ain't my thing
And you're the reason that I sing

Because you blow my mind
And the way you re talking baby you re so cool
I do anything for you

Unbelievable
Oh it s such a rush
So incredible
Boy you make me blush
Just keep it doing it throw me into space
And I ll be floating everyday

Because you blow my mind
And the way you re talking baby you re so cool
I do anything for you"
Rock,"Inside every teenage girl there's a fountain
Inside every young pair of pants there's a mountain
Inside every mother's eyes is Tommy Tinkrem's bed
Inside every candidate waits a grateful dead

I make it a thing, when I'm on my own to relieve myself
I make it a thing, when I gazelle on stage to believe in myself
I make it a thing, to glance in window panes and look pleased with myself
Yeah, and pretend I'm walking home

I took it so bad, I sat in the correction room
Took me a fag, and a kick in the moon
Well, I ain't gonna suck no radar wing
Because inside this tin is tin
Would you like to techno-plate cause I'm your candidate
Oh yeah

It's a matter of life
And the way you walk, you've got a BrylCream queen
It's a matter of tact
In the things you talk, that keeps his passport clean
A matter of fact
That a cock ain't a cock on a twelve inch screen
So I'll pretend I'm walking home

You don't have to scream a lot to keep an age in tune
You don't have to scream a lot to predict monsoons
You don't have to paint my contact black
Now I've hustled a pair of jeans
Do I have to give your money back when I'm the Fuhrerling

I'll make you a deal
I'll say I came from from Earth and my tongue is taped
I'll make you a deal
You can get your kicks on the candidate
I'll make you a deal
For your future's sake, I'm the candidate
Let's pretend we're walking home

uh-huh, uh-huh
I'm the candidate
I'm the candidate

Rock,"What becomes a legend most
when she's alone in a hotel lobby
What becomes a legend most
some bad champagne and some foreign bottled beer

What becomes a legend most
when the musicians have come and then leave her
What becomes a legend most
besides being a legendary star

What becomes a legend most
lying in bed cold and regal
What becomes a legend most
lying in bed watching a talk show on TV

What becomes a legend most
fifty days in fifty cities
And everyone says she looks pretty
at least as pretty as a legend should

Fifty days can wear you down
fifty cities flying by
A different man in each different hotel
and if you're not careful, word can get around

What becomes a legend most
not a bed, that is half empty
Not a heart, that is left empty
that's not pretty, not pretty at all

What becomes a legend most
when she's lying in her hotel room
What becomes a legend most
well baby, tonight it's you (tonight it's you)
Baby, tonight it's you

(What becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la) Baby, it's you
(what becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la) maybe tomorrow
(What becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la) Baby, it's you

"
Rock,"We turned water into wine but that didn't last
We were the victims of our age
Now we live on different floors
And go our separate ways
And talk behind closed doors
We changed our world waiting for it all to end
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart

We used to sit around the fire
And whisper words the world outside would make no claim to hear
But now we talk an octave higher
In droning tones that don't relate at all to yester year
We changed our world waiting for it all to end
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart

Do you remember when we were seventeen
We took a boat out for an hour
But we preferred the greenery to the scenery of the sea
And tied up in some cosy cove
Till harbour lights appeared across the bay, remember....

Into love and out of mind
A poet claimed that loving you has only made me blind
But love is really crystal clear
It's only when you need someone the clouds will soon appear
We changed our world waiting for it all to end
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart

Do you remember when laughter was the cure
For all the hard times that we knew
But we forgot to feed the fire - let it all burn down
Warmth returns to cold and poison into pain
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart, remember....."
Rock,"Mud Slide Slim and the blue horizon,
Oh, Mud Slide and depending on you.
I don't know but I've been told
There's a time from time to time
I can't eat, I can't sleep
But I just like to move my feet
'Cause there's nothing like the sound of sweet soul music
To change your lady's mind
And there's nothing like a walk on down by the bayou
To leave the world behind.

Mud Slide, I'm depending on you,
Mr. Mud Slide Slim on the blue horizon.
I've been letting the time go by, letting the time go by,
Yes, I'm letting the time go by, letting the time go by.

I wanted cash in my hand
Pick upon a piece of land
Build myself a cabin back in the woods.
Lord, it's there I'm gonna stay
Until there comes a day
When this old world starts changing for the good.

Now the reason I'm smiling
Is over on an island
On a hillside in the woods where I belong.
I wanna thank Jimmy Jimmy John and Mick and Robbie
Of Nojets Construction to send me down homestead on a farm.

Oh, Mud Slide, I'm depending on you.
Mr. Mud Slim on the blue horizon.
I've been letting the time go by, letting the time go by,
"
Pop,"Can we talk, throughout the night I need you so bad
And when we talk can you understand my feelings
And understand it hurts to be without you

Never prepared, never know what's going wrong
I'm losing though I always thought this love was so strong
So alone, so lost in the dark
So sad coz you will always have a place in my heart

Hangin onto your love
Hangin onto your love
Hangin onto your love
Hangin onto your love, I need it

Let's take a walk and reminisce about
The feelings we used to feel
Just say the word and I'll be back for good my baby
I'll be back to give you girl what you deserve

Did I say too much, did I try to rule your life
Did the love we had between us
Miss the road to paradise
Can we try again, can we chance it one more time
Can the ecstacy we found her
Be re-claimed as yours and mine

(chorus)
"
Rock,"Do you hear what I hear?
Do you see what I see?
Colin, I want you to use your imagination
You wake up one morning and you ask yourself

Why am I so exciting?
What makes me dramatic?
You're trying to say something about yourself
The dazzling crime of wisdom

You fall for reality
You're bruised and bewildered
Then you learn to fall in love with yourself
That's motivation

You raise yourself high
Presenting your soul
You step from the shadows
You hear the command
An image to dream
You tremble permission
Tomorrow's rewards bloody skies of today
You'll step out of time
Into life's every dream
A life of such powerful meaning

Now you has class
Now you has splash
Now you has mass motivation

Here's an image I can recommend
Here's a product you will die for
Here's a nightmare that will never end
Get you fired upp burning go oh oh

You know you got something
You know you got style
We don't take much just a little bit
That's motivation

Welcome to the world of your dreams, Colin
Where you can be what you want
Commit horrible sins
And get away with it

Lust
Gluttony
Pride
Anger
Sloth
Avarice
And jealousy

You know you got something
You know you got the style
We don't take much, but a little bit
That's motivation

No more false illusion
Goodbye to confusion
Stand out from the madding crowd
Motivation is symphony

Symphony in style (that's motivation)
It's brilliant, original (that's motivation)
Stimulating, encouragement (that's motivation)
As precious from home (that's motivation)
So what (motivation)
Say what (motivation)
New (moti)
So (moti)

Now you has class motiv
"
Pop,"Open your eyes

Make room for a little sweet love
The Lord is all around you, child
And that's what you're made of
Remember: there is a light

And it shines bright just for you
And you can't cut yourself off from it
No matter what you do

I had a 3. 5 at Duke
And I was blowin up
Three albums, I got a row of ducks
When my dad was 22
Dog he drove a truck
January in Detroit is cold as fuck
You know its tough
But I came this far I ain't slowin up
Livin life with the lebron james shoulder shrug
One thing you'll never hear me say is ""close enough""
I'm dope as fuck

I lost 2018 to a broken heart
I wrote this whole thing, I know my part
I made a wild fire from a glowing spark
I press go in March, I gotta go and march
All previous conceptions are blown apart
Not everyone can come with me it's Noah's Ark
I Ain't Gregg Popovich, I have no remark
These are the type riches one can only hold in heart

And anyone that's gone over my history
Knows I ain't stuck in the mold of the industry
I am walking down a road of epiphanies
Three words: Growth Over Consistency
Back again, they've been tapping out, McGregor
I've been tapping in
Livin out the dreams I was once just imagining
It's happening, I get so much work done nowadays
It's almost like I have a twin

I can't just sit on the couch
Shoveling shit in my mouth
I don't know how I'm gonna walk across this country
But I know I'm a figure it out

And who knows what I'm gonna do when it's done
Hopefully, I touch a life: you can be one
I'm not walking to show people who l am
I'm walking to find out who I'll become

The people ain't stupid, they know what's real
Sometime to get to heaven, we gotta go through hell
And I'm rollin' deep, no Adele
You can ask World Wide Wes, dawg, he knows me well
My life's like an instruction manual
How to not be borin' (Not be borin')
It's my spirit, my smile
That have got me soarin'
It broke my heart to tell the band
We would not be tourin'
But I just gotta do this (I gotta do it)
I can't stop explorin'
I was a short lil' Jewish kid, I ain't speak much
My whole life now somethin' that I've dreamed up
With no handout, I look at my heros and
That's what I am now

Yoga class headband now
People say I'm off-brand, how
I am a brand, therefore
Anything I do is on-brand now, I'm on-brand now
People got attached to a version of me
And it hurts when they see a person who's free
But I'm so grateful for all of these lessons
Twice as much money, half the possessions
No drugs, now the vision's clear
People mad 'cause the old me isn't here
All my gold jewelry just disappeared
That's the universe tellin' me to start switchin' gears
The deeper the human, the deeper the songs
Look at my life, the dream isn't gone
I saw all of this two years ago
It's almost like it was me readin' my poem

People copy but they copy wrong
Puttin' out a bunch of sloppy songs
If I die and the Rockies don't
Forget to bury me with Petoskey stone
And opportunities keep on poppin' up
Killer concepts come to me in shavasana
This is just an intro, a daydream
The rest comes January 18th

Open your eyes
Make room for a little sweet love
The Lord is all around you, child
And that's what you're made of
Remember
There is a light
And it shines bright just for you
You can't cut yourself off from it
No matter what you do, no

Open your eyes"
Rock,"Your brains went black
When she took back her love
And put it out into the sun.

The birds did fly
When the heavens all went dry
And the cigarettes were smoking by themselves.

She'll do anything
She'll do anything.
She'll do anything to make you feel like an asshole.

Call her name,
She looks the same as you,
With question marks stretched across her skin.

She dangles carrots
And makes you feel embarrassed
To be the fool you know you are.

She'll do anything
She'll do anything.
She'll do anything to make you feel like an asshole."
Rock,"Your sweet embrace, your hand in mine
So close together
How many times I've made you mine
Is this forever?
Promises and dreams we've shared
Do you remember?
Oh, here we are, so near and yet so far
From each other

Chorus:
Handle my heart with love
Don't let me hope in vain
Only your touch can save my heart
From breaking again

So handle my heart with love
Stay and you'll ease my pain
Only your touch can save my heart
From breaking again

Your gentle smile, your tender touch
So captivating
No other love has meant this much
And I'll go on waiting
One day in your arms I'll hear
This is forever
I know it's there, though right now it's hard to care
For each other

Repeat chorus

Don't make us part
Please don't brake my heart again"
Pop,"I've been working so hard
We spent too long apart
And you've been thinking
Playing tricks on your mind
Made your words sound unkind
You were cold, oh so cold
I can see from your tears you think it's over
Got the whole weight of our love
On your shoulders

You know as well as I do
That our prospects are good
If you think I'm leaving
Then you've misunderstood

Just smile and I'll be yours again
Baby just sing a little word in my ear again
Don't worry 'bout the things that you said
Don't mean anything
One smile that's when I'll be yours again

When you told me to go
You lost all self control, I was hurting
Now you're filled with regret
Cos you can't take it back
Feel all alone,
When you should of known

You don't need to make it a drama now
Cos you should know the way that I'm feeling
No need to complicate things to work this out
Here's how... smile"
Rock,"I saw her stangin' on her front lawn
Just twirlin' her baton
Me and her went for a ride sir
And ten innocent people died

From the town of Lincoln Nebraska
Aith a sawed-off .410 on my lap
Through to the badlands of Wyoming
I killed everything in my path

I can't say that I'm sorry
For the things that we done
At least for a little while sir
Me and her we had us some fun

The jury brought in a guilty verdict
And the judge he sentenced me to death
Midnight in prision storeroom
With leather straps across my chest

Sheriff when the man pulls
That switch sir and snaps my poor neck back
You make sure my pretty baby
Is sittin' right there on my lap

They declared me unfit to live
Said into that great void my soul'd be hurled
They wanted to know why I did what I did
Well sir I guess there's just a meanness in this world
"
Rock,"Listen to a lonely sound
See the grey and sadness all around
See the people go their way
Cannot of me and love I lost today
Maybe tomorrow I will love again
I'll never know until I looked into her eyes
Maybe tomorrow I will love again
I'll never know until I've seen her once or twice
And so I'm living for a dream
Each lonely day spent looking for the sunshine
I'll make believe that I don't care
I'll tell my friends I love my life
I'm happy
Maybe tomorrow I will love again
I'll never know until I looked into her eyes
Maybe tomorrow I will love again
I'll never know until I've seen her once or twice
Wherever, whoever you may be
Let the light of your love
Shine through the window of my heart
Then when you've coloured all my thoughts bright
Don't let me ever
Ever think of night, no
Maybe tomorrow you will love again
I'll never know until I looked into her eyes
Maybe tomorrow you will love again
I'll never know until I've seen her once or twice
Maybe tomorrow I will love"
Rock,"It's hard to know the way I feel
Not knowing if your love is real
So I won't
Upset myself
Seen you run from man to man
I could hate you but I understand
And I don't
I blame myself
It gets lonely
Lonely
Lonely with a broken heart

It's hard to know what I would say
If you would ever walk away
But I won't
Concern myself
It's hard to know what I would do
If you would find somebody new
But I don't
Upset myself
It gets lonely
Lonely
Lonely with a broken heart

When I'm thinking of you
Baby I still love you
If you ever need me
Baby please believe me
Lonely

Lonely with a broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart

It's hard to know the way I feel
Not knowing if your love is real

Rock,"Some say that I will and some say I won't
Victory is an elusive whore
She is as easily mine as she is yours

Slip and slide my way through this charade
I know all the players and I must say
Do this long enough, you get a taste for it

I'll do this last one and I'll grow me some wine
Leave them troubled boys all behind
What you stole I would have given freely
Code red, you're staring
Code red, staring at me

Well, sometimes he do and sometimes he don't
Sometimes I love myself best alone
Do this long enough, you get a taste for it

A six pack of Coke and a bottle of Jack
""Whatever you do"", he said, ""look after that.""
Being trusted and lusted, it could be worse than that

I'll do this last one and I'll grow me some wine
Leave them troubled boys all behind
What you stole I would have given freely
Code red, you're staring
Code red, you're staring
Code red

Come on, baby, I can drink you down
Then I have my job to do and do well
Since you won't give guarantees, I'll be cashing out

I'll do this last one and I'll grow me some wine

Oh the graffiti on the train, oh no
Rolled into her life
Oh the graffiti on the train, oh

Sets out, he left his lover sleeping
Rain falls, he's drowning in his secret
Wet streets are quiet as a church hall
Last house where children kick the football
Crossroads, his heart is beating faster
Getting close to asking her the question
""Marry me"", he wants to paint the words on
The night train, he's hiding with his spray cans
Tonight he's gonna ride
When the paint is done and dried, oh come on

Oh the graffiti on the train
Oh the graffiti on the train
Oh the graffiti on the train
Oh she'll never be the same, oh no
Rolled into her life
Oh the graffiti on the train, oh

Day breaks his lover yawns and wakes up
Sips a cup and dusts her face in make up
Platform, she hears the people whisper
Someone died, they surfed the train and slipped up
Train comes the coach she's always used to
The doors read a ""Marry me I love you""
Heart stops ecstatic and suspicious
She makes the call but he don't pick the phone up
The train sped down the line
It was the last train he would ride, oh no

Pop,"Flannels and ripped jeans
And friday nights
Now all I see
Is fields and fences
Remembering
Flickering lights
On a sunday
Just wanting to feel something

These memories won't let me be
So I just play them back
I see summer rain
And that Autumn change
It all came so fast
Smell of wood burning
Sparks jumpin' around
I thought by now
I'd have it all figured out

With our hoods up
And our hearts out
I was fearless
Before I got let down
I wonder if I could
Get back to that place now

I got two headlights
And a thousand miles to go
Two hundred feet of light
On this dark and windy road
Midnight stars haunt my sky
Burning scars fill my mind
I'm waiting on a wish to come true
Maybe I can find my way
Back to where I belong

Just following my headlights
Headlights
Maybe I don't have to see
Where I'm going
Just follow my headlights

I'm searching back roads
For wishes and dreams
Long gone
Ripped at the seams
Whispered a quiet prayer
In this heart of mine
Filled with questions
As big as the Tennessee sky

And like ghosts these memories
Just follow me around
Looking back I never thought that
I'd leave that town
Airplanes and shooting stars
Where my company all along
The moon stayed at the same
But those days are long gone

With our hoods up
And our hearts out
I was fearless
Before I got let down
I wonder if I could
Get back to that place now

I got two headlights
And a thousand miles to go
Two hundred feet of light
On this dark and windy road
Midnight stars haunt my sky
Burning scars fill my mind
I'm waiting on a wish to come true
Maybe I can find my way
Back to where I belong

Just following my headlights
Headlights
Maybe I don't have to see
Where I'm going
Just follow my headlights


With our hoods up
And our hearts out
I was fearless
Before I got let down
I wonder if I could
Get back to that place now

I got two headlights
And a thousand miles to go
Two hundred feet of light
On this dark and windy road
Midnight stars haunt my sky
Burning scars fill my mind
I'm waiting on a wish to come true
Maybe I can find my way
Back to where I belong

Maybe I will be alright
Maybe I don't have to know

Just following my headlights
Headlights
Maybe I don't have to see
Where I'm going
Just follow my headlights"
Pop,"That's my girl

Who's been working so damn hard
You got that head on overload?
Got yourself this flawless body
Aching now from head to toe
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
All my ladies 'round the world
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
Good girls better get bad

You've been down before
You've been hurt before
You got up before
You'll be good to go, good to go
Destiny said it, you got to get up and get it
Get mad independent
And don't you ever forget it
Got some dirt on your shoulder
Then let me brush it off for ya
If you're feeling me, put your five high
That's my girl

That's my girl
That's my girl

(Get up, what you waiting for?)
That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl

Nod if you been played by every boo
Just trying to show you off
Thought he was the best
You ever had until he cut you off
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
Bet, you bet, you know your worth
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
Good girls better get bad

You've been down before
You've been hurt before
You got up before
You'll be good to go, good to go
Destiny said it, you got to get up and get it
Get mad independent

That's my girl
That's my girl
(That's my girl, that's my girl
That's my girl, that's my girl)

Ain't nothing, ain't nothing, ain't nothing
Put your heart and your soul in it
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing, ain't nothing
Now put your heart and your soul in it

That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl

That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl"
Pop,"Chasing air!
Chasing air!

Red line to the other side
Still thinking about you tonight
It's raining hard
It's getting cold
I don't know which way to go
Feel so invisible
Ghosts walking down your hall
Throwing stones, you never called
This time I've hit the wall

Oh no, getting over you
Oh no

Tryna catch your heart
But it feels like chasing air
Gotta slow you down
I won't let you disappear
Tryna catch that star
Make a wish and you'll be here
Where'd you go?
Need to know
'cause it feels just like I'm chasing air
Feels just like I'm chasing air
Chasing air!
Straight past all the frozen lights
Your hold on me tonight
Empty streets and empty cars
Empty sky from the falling stars

Oh no, getting over you
Oh no

Tryna catch your heart
But it feels like chasing air
Gotta slow you down
I won't let you disappear
Tryna catch that star
Make a wish and you'll be here
Where'd you go?
Need to know
'cause it feels just like I'm chasing air
Feels just like I'm chasing air
Chasing air!

You played them games
Broke the rules
I came undone
How could I have believed your the one?
Oh no
You made those moves
I laughed so hard
With all that charm
How did you do so much harm?

Tryna catch your heart
But it feels like chasing air
Gotta slow you down
I won't let you disappear
Tryna catch that star
Make a wish and you'll be here
Where'd you go?
Need to know
'cause it feels just like I'm chasing air
Feels just like I'm chasing air"
Rock,"I know you're out there having a good time.
Spaced out chicks, love potions and good wine.
Don't make me laugh, you're not in there alone,
There's other people's voices in the room.

Don't hang up â€” I didn't mean it that way,
No eye communication â€” always happens this way.
How can I say what I mean, mean what I say ?
No eye communication always happens that way.

I know I shouldn't let it happen,
There's no excuse â€” I felt so alone.
You know how it is, our lure was meant to trap them â€”
And then they find some poison of their own.

Don't hang up â€” I didn't mean it that way,
No eye communication â€” always happens this way.
How can I say what I mean, mean what I say ?
No eye communication always happens ...

""Tyger, Tyger, burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry ?"" *

Don't hang up â€” I didn't mean it that way,
No eye communication â€” always happens this way.
How can I say what I mean, mean what I say ?
No eye communication always happens that way.

Don't hang up â€” I didn't mean it that way,
No eye communication â€” always happens this way.
How can I say what I mean, mean what I say ?

Like a morning girl
She's my angel up above my world
She's the only one who understands me
That's why I call her my new fan league

[chorus]
She's the only one that I want by my side
She's the only one that I believe can save my life
She makes me want to be a better man oh why
She's higher than the sky
The suns and the moon

She's like a star, like a star, like a star
She's like a star, like a star, like a star
She's like a star, like a star, like a star
She's like a star, like a star, like a star

Well you inspired me, to chase my wildest dreams
You mezmorized my world, I'll be your favorite girl
Like a melody, you release me, just like the greatest song
You are my number one

He's the only one I wat by my side
He's the only one I want by my side
He's the only one that I believe can save my life
He makes me want to be a better girl or wife

Hey, she higher than the sky the suns and the moon

She's like a star, like a star, like a star.
Oh baby, hes like a star
Ooh baby, shes like a star
Oh baby, hes like a star"
Rock,"Money, stole my lady
Fools, have a way, of making me crazy
Money, buy you freedom
Rules, have a way of making me lazy

And so we grow a little older
With another tale to tell
So we grow a little colder
With another tale to tell

Money, make you feel unhappy
Fools, have a way, of making me crazy

And so we grow a little older
With another tale to tell
So we grow a little colder
With another tale to tell

...

Feel like I'm flying, I'm dying to say
\""Want you forever and easy\""
Be where you are, where I want you to stay
Don't you know what I'm saying?
Believe me

Feel like I'm falling, it's all I can do
Lyin' and dyin' is lonely
Deeper and darker, no way to forgive
No way to believe what you told me
No way to believe what you told me
Way to believe

[guitar solo (Joey Molland)]

Kings in their castles wound up in the wine
Drinking their confidence daily
Wish I could be into that peace of mine
Wish I could be into crazy
Wish I could be into crazy
Wish I could be..."

Rock,"Broken like the windows in the house that loved to harm
She's staring into the glass
And I need conversation like I need another drink
Knowing these rivers are bound to pass
Don't know the words 'cause they're always changing
Oh, but I think I know what she means
Trapped in a motel and the sound of our lips
Lookin' around for Jeane
Lookin' around for Jeane
Nineteen years and nothing, baby where do I begin
Wait till you're 23
She said she knew some late night place that'd let us in
Outside it started to freeze
Don't know the words 'cause they're always changing
Oh, but I think I know what she means
Trapped in a motel and the sound of our lips
Lookin' around for Jeane
Lookin' around for Jeane
Lookin' around for Jeane
Lookin' around for Jeane"
Rock,"Fame, (fame) makes a man take things over
Fame, (fame) lets him loose, hard to swallow

That burns your change to keep you insane (sane)

Fame, (fame) what you like is in the limo

What's your name?"
Pop,"All along it was a fever
A cold sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air I said show me something
He said, if you dare come a little closer

Round and around and around and around we go
Ohh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay, stay
I want you to stay, ohh

Ohh the reason I hold on
Ohh 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the lights
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay, stay
I want you to stay, ohh
I want you to stay"
Rock,"Guess I got what I deserved
Kept you waiting there
Too long my love
All that time without a word
Didn't know you'd think,
That I'd forget
Or I'd regret
The special love I had for you
My baby blue

All the days became so long
Did you really think,
I'd do you wrong?
Dixie, when I let you go
Thought you'd realize that I would know
I would show
The special love I have for you
My baby blue

What can I do?
What can I say?
""Cept I want you by my side
How can I show you,
Show me the way
Times you know,
The times I've tried

Guess that's all I have to say
""Cept the feelin' just grows stronger,
Everyday
Just one thing before I go
Take good care baby,
Let me know
Let it grow
The special love you have for me
My dixie dear"
Pop,"You came to me, baby
And I though that I saw love in your eyes
But all the promises you made were not to be
I should have seen through your disguise

Ohh no baby you know you always tried
Make me look the fool, what's goin' on
You used to be so good to me now what is wrong

Tell me why you wanna hurt me
Is this the way that love has got to be
Now baby I can't take it
If this is love then love's not meant for me

What has happened to you lately
I don't sense that lovin', feelin' anymore
Everytime you bring me down I wanna cry
Do you wanna see me walkin' out that door

Tell me why you wanna hurt me
Is this the way that love has got to be
Now baby I can't take it
If this is love then love's not meant for me

Ohhh no baby you know you're always trying
To make me look the fool
Won't you tell me why you hurt me
Is this the love has got to be
No baby, I can't take it
If this is love then love's not meant for me

Tell me why you wanna hurt me
Is this the way that love has got to be
Now baby I can't take it
If this is love then love's not meant for me
"
Rock,"For we're living in a safety zone
Don't be holding back from me
We're living from hour to hour down here
And we'll take it when we can

It's a kind of living which recognizes
The death of the odourless man
When nothing is vanity nothing's too slow
It's not Eden but it's no sham

There is no hell
There is no shame
There is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell

And it's lights up, boys
Lights up boys

Explosion falls upon deaf ears
While we're swimming in a sea of sham
Living in the shadow of vanity
A complex fashion for a simple man

And there is no hell
And there is no shame
And there is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell

And the silence flies on its brief flight
A razor sharp crap shoot affair
And we light up our lives

And there's no more of me exploding you
Re-exposing you
Like everybody do
Re-exploding you

I don't know what to use
Make somebody move
Me exploding
Me exploding you
"
Rock,"Standing on the corner
suitcase in my hand
Jack is in his corset, and Jane is her vest
And me I'm in a rock'n'roll band Hah!
Ridin' in a Stutz Bear Cat, Jim
You know, those were different times!
Oh, all the poets they studied rules of verse
And those ladies, they rolled their eyes

Sweet Jane! Whoa! Sweet Jane, oh-oh-a! Sweet Jane!

I'll tell you something
Jack, he is a banker
And Jane, she is a clerk
Both of them save their monies, ha
And when, when they come home from work
Oh, Sittin' down by the fire, oh!
The radio does play
The classical music there, Jim
""The March of the Wooden Soldiers""
All you protest kids
You can hear Jack say, get ready, ah

Sweet Jane! Come on baby! Sweet Jane!
Oh-oh-a! Sweet Jane!

Some people, they like to go out dancing
And other peoples, they have to work, Just watch me now!
And there's even some evil mothers
Well they're gonna tell you that everything is just dirt
Y'know that, women, never really faint
And that villains always blink their eyes, woo!
And that, y'know, children are the only ones who blush!
And that, life is just to die!
And, everyone who ever had a heart
They wouldn't turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played a part
Oh wouldn't turn around and hate it!

Sweet Jane! Whoa-oh-oh! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane!

Heavenly wine and roses
Seems to whisper to her when he smiles
Heavenly wine and roses
Seems to whisper to her when she smiles
La lala lala la, la lala lala la
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane"
Pop,"These are the days of the open hand
They might just be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers

This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance
And legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we?l take our chances
?ause God? stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all God? children
Crept out the back door

And it? hard to love, there? so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it? much too much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

These are the days of the empty hand
Oh, you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year

This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say what? mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much but I?l take my chances
?ause God? stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can? come back
?ause he has no children to come back for

It? hard to love there? so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it? much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time"
Rock,"Children seem to have no choice
The children have got no voice
They're merely living to grow old
Letting their days unfold
And it's time that you and I
Realised that by and by

These children grow up into men
It is clear what we must do
What the Lord has told us to
Give our brothers a chance
To be born again

It's a small world, a small world
When you see it through
A pair of haitian eyes
It's a small world, a small world
When the dreams you dream
Melt into haitian skies

It's just not good enough to say
That the trouble's too far away
Cos the little that you need to give
Could help a little child to live

Help them live a little longer
Help them grow a little stronger
So why not play a part
If you're ever gonna do
What the Lord has told us to
It's got to begin within your heart

It's a small world, a small world
When you reach out and touch
a stranger
From where you stand
It's a small world, a small world
When you can forge another link
In a far off land

Repeat last two lines

It's a small world, a small world
When you can forge another link
In a far off land"
Rock,"Well Billy bought a Chevy '40 Coupe Deluxe
Chrome wheels, stick shift
Give her gas, pop the clutch
Little girls on the corner
Like a diamond they shine
Someday Billy I'm gonna make 'em all mine
Hey girl, you wanna ride in Daddy's Cadillac?
Because I love the way your long hair falls down your back

Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley's at the Seaside Bar
We'll run barefoot in the sand, listen to his guitar
You say your mum's gonna meet you when the morning comes
And your papa's gonna beat you 'cause he knows you're out on the run
I'm gonna live a life of love and tonight you're the one

The highway is alive tonight
So baby do not be frightened
There's something 'bout a pretty girl on a sweet summer
night
That gets this boy excited
Radio man finally understands and plays you something you can move to
You lay back easy ...
Your girl leans over and says
""Daddy, can you turn that radio up any louder?""

Ah, the juke joint's humming
Everybody came down
Little Willy and his Soul Boom putting all that stuff down
Well don't let that daylight steal your soul
Get in your wheels and roll, roll, roll, roll, roll

Mama's gonna meet you when the morning comes
And your daddy's gonna beat you 'cause he knows you're out on the run
But I don't care I'm gonna live and laugh and love while the night's still
young

Rock,"There's such a lot of good ways to be bad
And so many bad ways to be good, haven't paid my rent yet
I tell them sorry but I haven't got the money anymore

Just for today I thought I'd leave home alone, hold hands with day
And if I'm so bad, why don't they take me away?

Just like what you hear with a shell pressed to your ear
That's the sea in the trees in the morning
Hello the Universal
Good morning Steve, well you won't believe me today

Working doesn't seem to be the perfect thing for me so I'll continue to play
And if I'm so bad why don't they take me away?

Well a hippy trippy name dropper came through my door
He said: I just bumped into Mick he told me you know where to score?
No not me friend, I mind my own and my own minds me

Well my love is at the foot of your hand come what may
But if June comes first please won't you take me away"

And I'm through...
Toodle-oo!
Bye-Bye, Mein Lieber Herr
Farewell, Mein Lieber Herr
It was a fine affair
But now it's over
And though I used to care
I need the open air
You're better off without me, Mein Herr
Don't dab your eye, Mein Herr
Or wonder why, Mein Herr
I've always told you I was a rover
You mustn't knit your brow
You should have known by now
You'd every cause to doubt me, Mein Herr
The continent of Europe is so wide, Mein Herr
Not only up and down, but side to side, Mein Herr
I couldn't ever cross it if I tried, Mein Herr
So I do...
What I can...
Inch by inch...
Step by step...
Mile by mile...
Man by man
Bye-Bye, Mein Lieber Herr
Farewell, Mein Lieber Herr

Pop,"If I'm not the one you want
Take your time to figure out
Yeah

I'm staring at your picture every night
The scent of you still lingers in my mind
I wonder if you're alone and feel alright
and the sun has come out of the clouds

And sometimes when I listen to our song
The nights seem so cold and far too long
I wanna call you up cuz in the end
I keep writing letters to my garbage can

Lately, feels like I'm goin' crazy
And baby, come and lay down beside me

Chorus:
If I'm not the one you want (than who's he)
Take your time to figure out (and you'll see)
If I'm not the one you want (than maybe)
I'll be the one you need

I feel like it's on you I can depend
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Lived enough of building castles in the sand
Why can't we be forever

Lately, feels like I'm goin' crazy
And baby, come and lay down beside me

Chorus x2

Somewhere in the back of my mind
I know that you will be mine
And somehow, wish i could rewind
And leave all the worries behind

If I'm not the one you want
I'll be the one you need
(I'll be the one you need)
Take your time to figure out
I'll be the one you need
(I'll be the one you need)

Rock,"I wish I was the warrior king
in every language that I speak
Lord over all that I survey

With a message violent fury
at the center of my soul

I wish I was a warrior king
inscrutable benign
With a faceless charging power
always at my command
Footsteps so heavy that the world shakes
my rage instilling fear, ah, ha
Yet cautious firm but fair and good
the perfect Warrior King

I wish I installed angles
in every subject's house
Agents of my goodness
no one would be without
A steak on every plate
a car for every house
And if you ever crossed me
I'd have your eyes put out

You don't exist without me
without me you don't exist
And if logic won't convinced you
then there's always this
I'm bigger, smarter, stronger, tough
yet sensitive and kind
And though I could crush you like a bug
it will never cross my mind

It wouldn't cross my mind to your neck
or rip out your vicious tongue
It wouldn't cross my mind to snap your leg like a twig
or squash you like some slug
You are a violent messenger
and I'm not above your taunts
And if you hit me you know I'll kill you
because I'm the Warrior King

Rock,"written by Warren Zevon 1980 Zevon Music BMI

All you guitar players
Scalding hot
And Zeke's going at it
Givin' it everything he's got
'Cause anything goes
Whatever it takes
I might pitch a fit
But I won't put on my brakes

Stand in the fire, stand in the fire,
Stand in the fire, stand in the fire, stand in the fire
Stand in the fire, stand in the fire, stand in the fire
Stand in the fire, stand in the fire, stand in the fire

I see a red-headed girl
In the red silk dress
Ya' know, I'm asking her to dance with me
She might say yes
Feel the heat
From the beat
Don't it burn you too?
And all I want to do
Is just ....rock you

Now stand in the fire, stand in the fire,
Stand in the fire, stand in the fire, stand in the fire
Stand in the fire, stand in the fire, stand in the fire
Stand in the fire, stand in the fire, stand in the fire

Stand . . in the fire, stand in the fire
Stand . . in the fire, stand in the fire Stand . . in the fire, stand in the fire

Rock,"They say I'll love again someday
A true love will come my way the next time
But after you there'll be never be a next time
for me

They say that I'll find happiness in someone
else warm caress the next time
I'll soon forget your kiss
and heartaches such as this will
Just be ancient history

They say that I'm a fool to weep, that
I won't go on losing sleep_the next time
And someone else will mend the heart you've
broken_in two_

But how can I fall in love the next time
When I'm still so much in love_
with you
When I'm still so much in love_
with you"
Pop,"I remember talkin to you constantly
Cos we were cool like that
Playing silly games with you we had a ball
Going to the movies or just hangin out
Watching a DVD but now its lets do lunch
The limos picking you up around three, sayin
Hit me on my mobile I'm a little busy
Gotta a lot of people to call oh

Watcha talkin bout I don't really hear it
Cos you keep on fading out you're not coming through
Watcha gonna do watcha talkin bout
Who you think you're fooling theres no way I'm hanging out with someone like you
Watcha gonna do

It started when the fame and fans kept comin in
And then you changed on us
Then you told us you were cool and we were wrong
When I call you on the phone you act like you ain't home
Your checking your caller ID now I've seen it all why you getting fake on me?
Know you gotta lot of problems and you need to solve them
But it's not gonna be with me around me around oh with me around oh no

Chorus

Wish it be the same but I doubt that you could change
Cos you're caught up in your me myself and I don't give a
Cos I know we're not the ones to blame but we had it goin on
Till you started doin us wrong I'm not trying to be a hater but your words are stuck
I'm fed up and I've had enough oooh oooh tell me


Chorus Out
"
Pop,"Who we are
Who we are
Who we are

Who we are
Who we are
Who we are

I have to take control
So much is left untold
Trying to find myself
At times it's hard to know
Who we are, we are, we are

Words can cut so deep
Weighing down on me
Time and time I see how vicious the world can be

Who we are, we are, we are

[Chorus 2x]

We're beautiful
Our flaws and all
They're beautiful to me
It's who we are, who we are
It's who we're meant to be
Now never change a thing

We all have broken days
To paint it on our face
It gets too much to fake
And we wanna hide away
Who we are, we are, we are
Inside, inside

[Chorus]

We're beautiful
Our flaws and all
They're beautiful to me
It's who we are....
It's who we're meant to be
Now never change a thing

You've got to be you for yourself
Cuz you're like nobody else
Who you are, you are, you are, you are

[Chorus]

Our flaws and all
They're beautiful to me
It's who we are... it's who we're meant to be

We're beautiful
Our flaws and all
They're beautiful to me
It's who are... it's who were meant to be
Now never change a thing

Who we are, who we are, who we are
Who we are, who we are, who we are
Who we are, who we are, who we are

Who we are"
Rock,"

So you feel like life's a losing game?
You're climbing your mountains every day
Can't feel that sunshine on your face?
Give it time, give it hope, give it love, give it grace

Yeah, you think that all you try you'll fail
You keep comparing yourself to someone great
It's a waste of time, who cares anyway
You've gotta run, gotta climb, only you're in your way
Hey-yeah

So every dog has its day
If the stars line up that way
And every night has its day
If the sun comes up again

So you lost all hope, look for someone to blame
Yeah, you've got your crutch and that's okay
Take it real slow, take it day by day
You can be what you see, let the clouds blow away
Hey-yeah

So every dog has its day
If the stars line up that way
And every night has its day
If the sun comes up again

You're alright, you're alright, there's time
You're alright, you're alright, there's time
You're alright, you're alright, time is on your side

Hey-yeah, every dog has its day
If the stars line up that way
And every night has its day
If the sun comes up again

(Every dog has its day
If the stars line up that way
And every night has its day
If the sun comes up again)"

Could you put a good word in somehow ?

Rock,"Watching them come and go
The templars and the saracens
They're traveling the holy land
Opening telegrams

Torture comes and torture goes
Knights who'd give you anything
They bear the cross of coeuf de leon
Salvation for the mirror blind

But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear
Prayers they hide the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
You pray til the break of dawn
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And you'll believe you're loving the alien
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

Thinking of a different time
Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan

Watching them come and go
Tomorrows and the yesterdays
Christians and the unbelievers
Hanging by the cross and nail"
Rock,"When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone
Livin' alone
I think of all the friends I've known
When I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore

Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And loves so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live
All by myself
Anymore

When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live
Oh
Don't wanna live
By myself, by myself
Anymore
By myself
Anymore
Oh
All by myself
Don't wanna live
I never, never, never
Needed anyone

Pop,"So what's a young man to do
Had a million in the bank when I turned 22, alright
It might've saved me
Doing impressions of myself
So people say it hasn't changed me
If only that were true now
But ain't a artist in the game
That can do what I do.
I ain't your little secret no more
But listen real close, and I give you one more

See, all of these American dreams,
That I find myself living out
Mixed with all of these man-made woman
That I find myself digging out
They tell me all day long to get a bodyguard
To help myself get around
But I ain't ever been afraid of people getting inside,
I'm more afraid of what I got on the inside, getting out
And what was left, a perfect mess
Did we forget? A perfect mess
And what was left, a perfect mess
Did we forget?

Been a while since 09
Remember when I told you
It was it was a matter of time
Did you believe me? Did it take this long?
I told Sean if I ever got on that I'd
Never ever buy a chain with ice
And I didn't
Before this all changed my life,
From dreams in the dorm room to doing big things
In the boardroom

See, all of these non-American bottles
That I find myself sipping out
Mixed with all of the things I'mma have to relearn
How to one day live without.
Mixed all of the things inside my head
I can't figure out

But I ain't ever been afraid of people seeing inside,
I'm more afraid of what I got on the inside, getting out
And what was left, a perfect mess
Did we forget, a perfect mess
And what was left, a perfect mess
Did we forget?"
Rock,"I'm not much on mystery
Yeah you gotta be careful what you dream
I thought this might pass with time
Yeah I thought I was satisfied

Chorus
But oh baby let me tell you, I got a thing about you
Baby let me tell you, I got a thing about you
It don't matter what you say
It don't matter what you do
I, I, I, got a thing about you

Somewhere deep in the middle of the night
Lovers hold each other tight
Whisper in their anxious ears
Words of love that disappear

(Repeat Chorus)

Baby you hold some strange control over me
Yeah it's so wild it hypnotizes me"
Rock,"I'm a rock'n roll juvenile,
Watch me run a mile,
When they play Beethoven,
I'm a rock'n roll groovy mover,
I only dig Beethoven,
When he's been rolled over.

I'm a rock'n roll holy roller,
I love to sing 'bout Jesus,
Cos he saved my soul-a,
I'm a rock'n rolling believer,
Roll a rock at the Devil,
He's just a deceiver,
(Roll the rock).

Look at me, I'm your rock'n roll man,
Been a rock'n roll fan since it began,
Look at me, follow me if you care,
I've found a rock'n roll heaven,
I'll take you there.

Look at me here I am,
Get a rock'n roll band,
I am a rock'n roll frontman,
Love a solo guitar,
It could take you far-take it-take it away."

Sayin' it alright, I don't mind

Different people, different games
People, people, love a lot
Feel the love inside your heart

Love is easy, easy
When you've opened up your heart
Love is easy, easy
When you know you'll never part

Well, love is easy, love is strange

People, people, love a lot
Feel the love inside your heart

Love is, love is easy, said easy
When you've opened up your heart
Easy, easy
When you know you'll never part

When you've opened up your heart

When you know you'll never part

Said easy, easy

Rock,"She's up there all alone
I'm down here changing lanes
Her room was dark and cold
I'm listening to the waves

And I'm depending on time, babe
To get you out of my mind

Chorus
I guess it's one of those things
You can never explain
Like when an angel cries
Like runaway trains

Like one of those times
That's never the same
Like when someone dies
Like runaway trains

She says 'I understand
I'm used to being alone
And holding my own hand
I'm stronger than you know'

Don't blame me

Rock,"And through the life force and there goes her friend
On her Nishiki it's out of time
And through the portal they can make amends
Hey would you say whatever, we're blanket friends

Can't stop what's coming
Can't stop what is on it's way

And through the walls they made their mudpies
I've got your mind I said; she said I've your voice
I said you don't need my voice, girl, you have your own
But you never thought it was enough of
So they went years and years
Like sisters, blanket. blanket girls
Always there through that and this
There's nothing we cannot ever fix I said

Can't stop what's coming
Can't stop what is on its way
Hey can't stop what's coming
Can't stop what is on its way

Bells and footfalls and soldiers and dolls
Brothers and lovers she and I were
Now she seems to be sand under his shoes
There's nothing I can do

Can't stop what's coming
Can't stop what is on its way
Can't stop what's coming
Can't stop what is on its way

And now I speak to you, are you in there?
You have her face and her eyes but you are not her
And we go at each other like blankets
Who can't find their..their thread and their bare

Can't stop, can't stop loving
You can't stop loving
Can't stop what is on its way
And I see it coming
And it's on its way"
Rock,"Everyone, when she was young,
They said she was the pretty one
She’s lovely now, just watch her as she goes
Waiting for the birds to come
She holds the hands of someone young
Whose mother comes and she sees her and she smiles
Thank you Louise
Thank you Louise
Mother of three
Waiting in the check-out line
The supermarket, Christmas time
She eyes someone who doesn’t have the change
Takes a dollar from her purse
She pays and doesn’t say a word
She winks and grins and ‘Merry Christmas, friend!’
Thank you Louise
Thank you Louise
Mother of three
In Baltimore, the freezing cold,
That chills her darling to the bone
She leaves her work and cuts her job (?)
Her brother lay upon the bed
With broken teeth and busted head
He hears the phone and he knows his brother’s dead
Thank you Louise
Thank you Louise
Mother of two"
Pop,"The sun goes down too early
The wind goes down my back just like it owns me
I work my job I get my check
I'm tryin' not to let myself get lonely
I'm just dreamin' about the day that I can
Show you all the love I've got for you
I used to hear my heart cry out
I used to feel it pound in me
I used to think It'd break me right in two
Now that seems so long ago
I'm feelin' like there's nothin' I can't do
I'm just dreamin' about the day when I can
Show you all the love I've got for you
Sometimes I can see your face
Taste your lovin' in my mouth
Baby I am comin' back for more
Can't you feel me comin'
Can't you see me comin'
Can't you hear me knockin' on your door?
I'm just dreamin' about the day when I can
Show you all the love I've got for you
I've got so much love for you

Rock,"Stay here the whole night the crowd is quite shady
Sit here expanding my time
I'm reading a message carved in the bar top
Drowning your sorrows, no cry
Take these wise words, and order another
In a place where my misery has friends
Drown out the past, this feeling won't last
But now I'm not thinking about when
No I'm not thinking about when

It's so amazing to be here on top of the world
Wish I could stay here where everything is clear to me
It's so amazing to be here on top of the world
Tomorrow comes crashing and who knows where I will be
It's never forever but right now I'm feeling free

Night rambles on, it's getting quite messy
I'm feeling I don't like this place
Johnny is sleeping right on the counter
Lipstick all over his face
I know what I want, it comes with a chaser
I'll buy one more round for my friends
Won't be my last call 'cause time is on my side
And still I'm not thinking about when
Nobody's thinking about when

It's so amazing to be here on top of the world
Wish I could stay here where everything's clear to me
It's so amazing to be here on top of the world
Tomorrow comes crashing and who knows where I will be
It's never forever but right now I'm feeling free

What can we all do?
What can we all do?

It's so amazing to be here on top of the world
Wish I could stay here where everything is clear to me
It's so amazing to be here on top of the world
Tomorrow comes crashing and who knows where I will be
Yeah

It's so amazing to be here on top of the world
Wish I could stay here where everything is clear to me
It's so amazing to be here on top of the world
Tomorrow comes crashing and who knows where I will be
It's never forever but right now I'm feeling free"
Rock,"I heard the song, it was all around
Everyone's quitting, everyone's breaking down
I called your house on the telephone
Nobody answered, but I know you're home

All in all, it's nature's poetry
I can't understand the way it flows
I don't wanna know
No, I don't wanna know
Cuz everything I know makes me feel so low
No, I don't wanna know

I pushed a button just to find my way
I got directions but I'm still lost today
I see her smiling, but her eyes were dead
Nobody's crying, that's what paper said

All in all, it's nature's poetry
I can't understand the way it goes
I don't wanna know
No, I don't wanna know
Cuz everything I know makes me feel so low

Can't promise you oh that perfect life

Always out of reach, ignoring every sign

If you take me, if you take me, they're yours
And if you see tomorrow I'll give you it all
Take me, take me, I'm yours

You should know cos I care about you
And you deserve more than any truth
The dirt and soil it's still beneath my nails
Don't know how to win only how to fail

I have so many, so many flaws

It's funny how you can be the only I see

Oo, oo, do...
New thoughts
Will purify my mind

New lives
will fall together like an endless story


All the love of the universe
will be shared by all that's living


And I don't really care
about tomorrow
Today
is all I really need to find the answers


I'll find the constant flow
of all the harmony


Everybody needs a helpin' hand

Rock,"People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
And lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace

CHORUS
And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight (second time: really quite paradise)
And he sang all night long

Femme fatales emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
Lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and dismay

CHORUS

Oh how I sighed when they asked if I knew his name

CHORUS
"
Rock,"Behind the walls where heat lightning falls
On five starred gnat-faced princess
The buffalo man shoots at the tin cats
Turns and shouts ""Children, blow your bridges""
On death row halls where dustmen stall
Where time's an enemy and a friend
At night jackals crawl from the cracks in the walls
And salvation is never spoken
Morning sickness breaks the garrison gate
The cavalry cries for treason
The soldier strokes his pony and goes to shine the Captain's sword
In this young boy's eyes lie reason
And the sergeant bursts in and cries ""I caught a prisoner, Captain,
A prisoner, what ho !""
The Captain looks up and says ""Let her go""
""But Captain, she patrols the light ships that patrol the sea around
The rainbow tips, whose bagpiper wail unbroken
She haunts the night and the dawnin' light
On her sounds and words your cavalry chokin' ""
The Captain says ""Have no fear, boys
For what you hear
Because danger can't be spoken ""

The whirlwind crackles and I hear the rustle of shackles
From the stockade door bursts Merlin
His eyes red, and swollen, like they've been pushed into the sun
His robes aflame and burnin'
He jumps a horse, tries to get away
But he gets caught in his eyes, tangled in his eyes
He falls to the ground, his neck is broken
His spirit rises high in the western sky

The magician lies an empty token
the sergeant walks over and kicks his body
And says ""Captain, he's dead - What shall we do with him ?""
The Captain says ""Hang him
For though his live moments on this earth are well spent
And I can se his body is sure well bent
It's magic that must be broken ""

Now night cradles low
The penniless weed plays wrath felt in the Captain's corner
With anvil spread wide, the Captain glides
Each blow to scare her, not to hurt her
She spits ""what truth"" at the Captain's boots
But he holds his rage suspended
The sergeant comes in stinkin' of soldier's gin
And cries ""Captain, the storm she blows unending""
Oh and the lightning cracked and the sky was hacked
By dagger rain it was torn
And the yard was charged into a raging sea
And the Captain ran crazily
For the first time in his life, in the Captain's heart
Fear was born

The Captain storms out on the stoop, panic strikes
He sees Merlin's hung body stretched by the neck
Silhouetted on his door
The sergeant screams ""Captain, look high, look to the sky !""
Some whirling, swirling emission ...
But the Captain falls to his knees crying silent pleas
'Cause he knows, he knows, and he thinks to himself
""A Magician...""

Rock,"You told me don't you look at the sun,
it burns your eyes out.
I disobeyed and see a man who's going nowhere.
He fed me this: you don't got to worry, you're on your feet.
Please help me down.
Should have made room for others who can't be beat into open sea.
I brainstormed and caught up with my friend who's doing fine now.
It's been uplifting knowing you all have static sources.
I fed him this: man, am I in a hurry to break this chord of our paranoia.
Took him too long to notice and now I'm down where I can't be found.
And there's no antidote for a petty loaf.
I think we've found the lighter side of our friendly host.
I don't mean to boast, we can face all this nonsense.
"
Pop,"Good job 1st

I fell in love with a sunset, I fell in love with a cloud
I don't remember how I got here, I just know I'm lookin' down
It's fun up here, feelin' real good
Man, it's fun up here, I'm feelin' real good
I feel in love with my damn self
My freckles and my back (My freckles and my back)
I fell in love with the whole world, I know it loves me back
That's why it put me high
It's fun up here, feelin' real good
It's fun up here, I'm feelin' real good
I'm just slidin' down a rainbow, got a lot leg room
I'm lookin' for my pot of gold (I'm lookin' for my pot of gold)
I know I'll get it soon
Uh, I got love in my blood, man, I'm feelin' real yummy
John Hamilton and Attaman, I'm keepin' good company
I call my pair of eyes ""Pretty, "" and a rainy day is ugly
Man, I ain't got nothin', so you can't take nothin' from me
'Cause it's fun up here, and I'm real good
You know it's fun up here, I'm feelin' real good

Yeah, uh
I woke up today in a mansion
I'm seven out of ten handsome
But my talent make me a ten and then some
Kick it to the curb, Ted Danson
Chillin' in a droptop, pedal to the high top, my studio is a hotbox
No baby, don't stop, no baby, don't drop
Can't see these haters like a Bird Box
Livin' on food stamps, dyin' on welfare
Dyin', and I had no healthcare
Wake up blessed everyday, life's slippin' away
And I'm actin' like I don't care
I got a job, I got a bed, I got a beautiful home, I ain't there
I got a mind on my own, I'm richer than money
Oh yeah boy you heard what I said
Money can't fill your heart, money can't fill your heart
(No, no, no, no)
Money can't fill your heart, money can't fill your heart
(No, no, no, no)
Money can't fill your heart, money can't fill your heart
(No, no, no, no)
Money can't fill your heart, only love can fill your heart
Only fill your heart

It's fun up here, feelin' real good
Man, it's fun up here, I'm feelin' real good"
Rock,"Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like i am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like i am whole again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like i am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
you make me feel like i am fun again
However far away
I will always love you
However long i stay
I will always love you
Whatever words i say
I will always love you
I will always love you
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like i am free again
Whenever i'm alone with you
You make me feel like i am clean again
However far away

However long i stay

Rock,"She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back
And never took her out
She wore a trenchcoat khaki
Her hobnail boots were full of holes

She's got medals

Her mother called her Mary, but she changed her name to Tommy, she's a one, oh
She went and joined the army, passed the medical
Don't ask me how it's done
They sent her to the front line
Fighting for her country's name

She's got medals

She got very tired of picking up girls
Cleaning her gun and shaving her curls
Then the enemy dropped a bomb
Survivors there were none

People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed
You can see her ghost but that's a lie because the naughty woman isn't dead
She deserted on the previous morning
Replaced her uniform with dresses silk and green
Called herself Eileen
Came to London town
Now she's settled down

"
Pop,"Don't want nobody who don't satisfied, I spent a lifetime tonight,
Of all the things I thought were right, someone who don't need to fight
Maybe you feel what I feel it could be, better than ever before,
Trying to fight (find????) what is meaning to me, baby it's you I adore,

Cause I only wanna be with, only wanna be with, only wanna be with you,
Cause I only wanna be with, only wanna be with, only wanna be with you

I go to pieces everytime you're near, without you I won't survive,
You say the words I wanna hear, you know your love is so right,
Over and over with you in my head, feelings I cannot ignore,
Finding a reason in things that you say, you in my life ever-more

Cause I only wanna be with, only wanna be with, only wanna be with you,
Cause I only wanna be with, only wanna be with, only wanna be with you

Wanna be with you, wanna be with me, when the music plays take a chance on me
All the things you do, all the little signs, wanna be with you wanna make you mine

Over and over with you in my head, feelings I cannot ignore,
Finding a reason in things that you say, you in my life ever-more

Cause I only wanna be with, only wanna be with, only wanna be with you,
Cause I only wanna be with, only wanna be with, only wanna be with you"
Pop,"Your stare swallows me
And I can hardly breathe
I feel it's dangerous
Could be deadly
Somehow I'm willing to do the things you want
Take me in your arms
Spoon-feed my heart and

Drip by drip
I'll take it all
Sip by sip
I guess that it's
Make or break
Boy here tonight

Chorus
We're caught in a moment
And I won't let it go
I am falling deeper, losing my control
Involved in a feeling
Like the blink of a eye
And the silence it belongs to you and I

Broke through barriers
And passed a state of mind
I'm not scared no more
It feels divine
So take me in
And catch me when I fall
I'm waiting on the edge
Uncut my soul

Snip by snip
I'm oozing it
Bit by bit
I'm taking it
Step by step
Boy here tonight

Chorus
We're caught in a moment
And I won't let it go
I am falling deeper, losing my control
Involved in a feeling
Like the blink of a eye
And the silence it belongs to you and I

Secretly I let it slip
Emotional I fall through it
All I know I'm losing my control
way too far
And there's no turning back
And now I'm shedding all my fears
I know, I know

Chorus
We're caught in a moment
And I won't let it go (let it go)
I am falling deeper, losing my control (my control)
Involved in a feeling (involved in a feeling)
Like the blink of a eye (eye)
And the silence it belongs to you and I (I)

Pop,"Right now!

I am an antichrist
I am a sporty spice
Don't know what I want but I know how to get it
I wanna destroy the passer by cos

I wanna be anarchy
No dogs body

Anarchy for the U.K
It's coming sometime and maybe
I give a wrong time stop a trafic line
Our future dream is a shopping scheme cos

I wanna be anarchy
In the city

How Many ways to get what you want
I use the best I use the rest
And I use the enemy
And I use anarchy cos

I wanna be anarchy
It's the only way to be

Is this the M.P.L.A
Or is this the U.D.A
Or is this the I.R.A
I thought it was the U.K

Or just another country
Another council tenancy

Rock,"My love for you is real
It moves like a summer breeze
My love for you is strong
Lord it brings me to my knees

It’s born in the wild
This real love
Love strong
True love is ours
Honey now
My love for you is real

My love for you is gone
Candy sweet and thunder strange
My love for you is wild
It breaks the lockets melting

My love for you is long
Across the oceans all the same
My love for you is true
Need exchange the love it takes

It’s born in the wild
This river long
Love strong
True never stings
Honey now
My love for you is real

Uh huh
It’s real, ohhh
It’s real, ohhh
Honey now

My love for you is real"
Rock,"I was found after losing my way,
Safe and sound after many a day.
I was lost in a world of madness,
Please take me from all of this sadness.


CHORUS
Comfort me, in whatever I do.
Comfort me, and I'll comfort you too.
Follow me, 'cause I'm trying to love you.


Can't figure out what's wrong with my head,
I used to think I wish I was dead.
You took me from all of that sorrow,
My future's bright, I can't wait 'till tomorrow.


CHORUS


There ain't nothin' to it, anyone can do it,
It's easy when you're feelin' right.
I know that I feel good, and I know that you should,
Stop not doin' what you know is right.


Don't know what it is that's causing this feeling,
What ever it is I'm touching the ceiling.
I won't let go of this beautiful sound,
I once was lost but now I am found.


CHORUS


I just don't want to be your friend, yeah.
You can trust me 'till the very end, yeah.
I know just what I'm talkin' about, yeah, yeah.
I'm talkin 'bout the love that you can't live without, no, no.


"
Rock,"Many's the time I've been troubled in mind
And I've not known where to go
Deeper and darker, no way to believe
Lying and dying, no way to conceive
Making believe it's not true
What in the world can you do?

Sail away, give it all to another day
Sail away, throw it over your shoulder

You may find in your heart
That you've made a new start with a future not so bad
Then you can show all the feelings you know
With a will to carry on, carry on, carry on

Then you can know all the feelings you show
And you'll know just where to go
Deeper and darker's no way to believe
Lying and dying's no way to conceive
Making believe it's not true
What in the world can you do?

Sail away, give it all to another day
Sail away, throw it over your shoulder
You may...
Carry on, carry on, carry on, carry on."
Pop,"Oh, oh, oh
(oh-oh-oh-oh)

Why you gotta hug me
Like that every time you see me?
Why you always making me laugh
Swear you're catching feelings

I loved you from the start
So it breaks my heart

When you say
I'm just a friend to you
Cause friends don't do the things we do
Everybody knows you love me too
Tryna be careful with the words I use
I say it cause I'm dying to
I'm so much more than just a friend to you

Mm, mm, mm
When there's other people around
You never wanna kiss me
You tell me it's too late to hang out
And you say you miss me

And I loved you from the start
So it breaks my heart

When you say
I'm just a friend to you
Cause friends don't do the things we do
Everybody knows you love me too
Tryna be careful with the words I use
I say it cause I'm dying to
I'm so much more than just a friend to you

You-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh-oh

You say
I'm just a friend to you
Friends don't do the things we do
Everybody knows you love me too
I tried to be careful with the words I use
I say it cause I'm dying to
I'm so much more than just a friend to you

A friend to you
A friend to you

(a friend to you...)"
Rock,"Won't you take one link
From this misery chain
Keep it to remind you
Of a long forgotten time or a place
So that you recognize
Its shape, when it's near
Any time or place this
Misery chain should appear

Take the locks and shackles
And melt all of it down
Shine a light upon
Every shadow
Every acre of ground
The hidden corners
On in all around
Anyway you feel this
Misery chain should be found

When we're gone
And it's all said and done
What will we leave
Stories told, will they speak
Of us when God only knows
That those word will be

And if I should fall
From the top of the world
To the depths below
So far below where our believe could exist
Down further still will be
The one who hides the key
And there's to try to put
These misery chains on me

When we're gone
And it's all said and done
What will we leave
Stories told, will they speak
Of us when God only knows
That those word will be

Won't you take one link
From this misery chain
Keep it to remind you
Of a long forgotten time or a place
So that you recognize it
'Till it's understood
And that every trace of
This misery chain is gone for good
'Til every trace of
This misery chain is gone for good"
Pop,"[Chorus]
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming

Back where I belong
Teah I never felt so strong
(I'm back baby)
I feel like there's nothing that I can't try
and if you with me put your hands high
(put your hands high)

If you ever lost a light before, this one's for you
And you, the dreams are for you

I hear ""The Tears of a Clown""
I hate that song
I feel like they talking to me when it comes on
Another day another dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math I'm gone
What am I s'posed to do when the club lights come on
It's easy to be Puff, it's harder to be Sean
What if the twins ask why I ain't marry their mom
(why, damn!)
How do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown
Damn!
But I ain't finished growing
Another night the inevitible prolongs
Another day another dawn
Just tell Keisha and Taresha I'll be better in the morn'
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place I belong

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
""A house is Not a Home"", I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, play ball and we keep ballin'
Baby, we've been living in sin
'Cause we've been really in love
But we've been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your home
Pick up your phone, come on

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
""Ain't No Stopping Us Now"", I love that song
Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
We back cruising through Harlem, Viso blocks
It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away then embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog
(I miss you BIG)
And here I stand, a better man!
(a better man)
Thank you Lord
(Thank you Lord)

[Chorus]"
Rock,"Sometimes late at night
I turn on the radio
Your music fills the room
I just can? t seem to get away from you

Saw a life size paper doll of you
In a record store
My friends as well as me
Can? t seem to let you go
It was finished long ago

Sometimes he? s my best friend
Even when he? s not around
But the sound of his voice
Well, it follows me down
And reminds me

Another famous friend told me
Love does end
Make a clean break
He didn? t talk about heartache
You have to let him go
Oh oh

Get over it
Remember how it was
Before our infamous pasts had begun
You have to let him go
He gives such hard advice, oh

He gives such hard advice
He says don? t think twice
Turn off the radio
It was finished long ago
Go write some real songs
This is all wrong

Sometimes he? s my best friend
Even when he? s not around
But the sound of his voice
Well, it follows me down
And reminds me

Sometimes he? s my best friend
Even when he? s not around
But the sound of his voice
Well, it follows me down
And reminds me

You have to get over this
The pain? s gone on too long
Go and write some real songs
Stay out of music stores
Don? t buy that doll

Sometimes, sometimes

Turn off that radio

Turn off that radio
Don? t buy that doll
Don? t buy that doll"
Pop,"I can't make coffee, stare out of my window
Cause that's the place you left me, standing there
I hate this hallway for memories in the frames
Are a sobering reminder you're not here

Yeah, I know I make mistakes
Cause my pride is in the way
You slipped right through my hands
But if you were here right now l
ong enough to hear me out
I can make you understand

(Chorus)
If these walls could talk
They'd tell you how much I miss you
How I'm trying everyday to forget you
How I'm crying every night cause
I wish you were here with me

If these walls could talk
They'd tell you that I never deserved you
They know I never meant to hurt you
Baby, you would know it all
If these walls could talk
(These walls, these walls, these walls) (x2)


I lay in my bedroom, and dream of when I had you
When I wake the sad truth closes in
It's really over, you're not coming back, no
Don't think I can handle all of this


Yeah, I know I make mistakes
Cause my pride is in the way
You slipped right through my hands
But if you were here right now
long enough to hear me out
I can make you understand

(Chorus)
If these walls could talk
They'd tell you how much I miss you
How I'm trying everyday to forget you
How I'm crying every night cause
I wish you were here with me

If these walls could talk
They'd tell you that I never deserved you
They know I never meant to hurt you
Baby, you would know it all
If these walls could talk

You'd believe that everything I say, I mean
You would know how much I need you now

(Chorus)
If these walls could talk
They'd tell you how much I miss you
How I'm trying everyday to forget you
How I'm crying every night cause
I wish you were here with me

If these walls could talk
They'd tell you that I never deserved you
They know I never meant to hurt you
Baby, you would know it all
If these walls could talk"
Pop,"Time when I was down and out
No loving in my life
This angel came and brought about
A meaning of some right
Took my dark and lonely days
Into the light
With his loving ways

He's my wonderful
Everything a girl could want to love
And all I need
Yes he's my wonderful
Must have been sent from
Up above
Just for me

Gotta have him close to me
Each and every night
To give me that security
Of dreaming in delight
Love has got a grip on me

Oh so tight
Hope he never lets go
He's my wonderful
Everything a girl could want to love
And all I need
Yes, he's my wonderful
Must have been sent from
Up above
Just for me

Cause I don't ever want to be free
From this love and care that
Most people will never see
And all night I pray
That I'll have my way
And enjoy love for eternity

He's my wonderful
Everything a girl could want to love
And all I need
Yes he's my wonderful
Must have been sent from
Up above
Just for me

No one can ever do just for me
The things he does cause

He's my wonderful
Everything a girl could want to love
And all I need
Yes he's my wonderful
Must have been sent from
Up above
Just for me"
Rock,"Faded pictures in an old scrapbook
Faded pictures that somebody took
When you were hard and young and proud
Back against the wall running raw and loud

Snakeskin vest and a sharkskin suit
Cuban heels on your boots
Kick in the band and side by side
You take the crowd on their mystery ride

Knights of Columbus and the Fireman's Ball
Friday night at the Union Hall
Black leather clubs all along Route 9
You count the names of the missing as you count off time

Flock of angels lift me somehow
Somewhere high and hard and loud
Somewhere deep into the heart of the crowd
I'm the last man standing now
I'm the last man standing now

Out of school and out of work
Thrift store jeans and flannel shirt
The lights go down and we face the crowd
The last man standing now

Lights come up at the Legion Hall
Pool cues go back up on the wall
You pack your guitar and have one last beer
With just the ringing in your ears

Flock of angels lift me somehow
Somewhere high and hard and loud
Somewhere deep into the heart of the crowd
I'm the last man standing now
I'm the last man standing now
I'm the last man standing now"

Evil, dancing through fire
Whore of Babylon, world famous clear

Longing, for something now
Waiting, hour after hour
Give me some of your power

Citadel, a prison of sorts
Only the rich make the laws
Using repression and force

Hidden, and very much here
Hatred summoned so near
Whore of Babylon, world famous clear"
Rock,"There's strange weather in the back of the room
And she's pretty just a-spinning the tunes
Eye lashes, and some white leather boots

Love is hell
Love is hell
Love is . . hell

It's just an answer here by my side
I found it out just in time

Rock,"The rangers had a homecoming in Harlem late last night
And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine over the Jersey state line
Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain
The Rat pulls into town rolls up his pants
Together they take a stab at romance and disappear down Flamingo Lane

Well the Maximum Lawman run down Flamingo chasing the Rat and the barefoot
girl
And the kids round here look just like shadows always quiet, holding hands
From the churches to the jails tonight all is silence in the world
As we take our stand down in Jungleland

The midnight gang's assembled and picked a rendezvous for the night
They'll meet `neath that giant Exxon sign that brings this fair city light
Man there's an opera out on the Turnpike
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley
Until the local cops, Cherry Tops, rips this holy night
The street's alive as secret debts are paid
Contacts made, they vanished unseen
Kids flash guitars just like switch-blades hustling for the record machine
The hungry and the hunted explode into rock'n'roll bands
That face off against each other out in the street down in Jungleland

In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the D.J. plays
Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners
Desperate as the night moves on, just a look and a whisper, and they're gone

Beneath the city two hearts beat
Soul engines running through a night so tender in a bedroom locked
In whispers of soft refusal and then surrender in the tunnels uptown
The Rat's own dream guns him down as shots echo down them hallways in the
night
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light

Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz
Between flesh and what's fantasy and the poets down here
Don't write nothing at all, they just stand back and let it all be
And in the quick of the night they reach for their moment
And try to make an honest stand but they wind up wounded, not even dead
Tonight in Jungleland
"
Pop,"Love to me
Is beautiful
Beautiful
And cruel

Love to you
Is dangerous
And dangerous
Is cool

When there's nothing else to do
And there's nothing on TV
If that's love to you
Well it isn't love to me
And if there's nothing left to say
Then there's nothing we can do
If that's love to you

Love to me
Should be glamorous
Adventurous
And sometimes sad

Love to you
Is curious
But it's nothing more (nothing more)
To you than there (nothing there)

When there's nothing else to do
And there's nothing on TV
If that's love to you
Well it isn't love to me
And if there's nothing left to say
Then there's nothing we can do
If that's love to you

If that's love to you
If that's love to you, oh-whoa

Love to me
Is history
Cos the mystery
Leaves you cold

When there's nothing else to do
And there's nothing on TV
If that's love to you
Well it isn't love to me
And if there's nothing left to say
Then there's nothing we can do
If that's love to you

If that's love to you
Is that love to you-oh-whoa

Rock,"Starry night bring me down
Till I realize the moon
It seems so distant yet I felt it pass right through
And I see what I see a new world is over me
So I'll reach up to the sky
And pretend that

I'm a spaceman
In another place and time
I guess I'm looking for a brand new place
Is there a better life for me?

Subtle wind blow me gone
Let me rest upon your move
I trust I'll end up sleeping cradled in my doom
And I feel what I feel
I can't grasp what is not real
So I'll get myself real high
And imagine

I'm a spaceman
In another place and time
I guess I'm looking for a brand new place
Is there a better life for me?

I remember in my mind
They say I'm daydreaming
Is it all that it seems
Or am I all the things I'm looking for? ?ooh!
And I see what I see a new world is over me
And I'll reach up to the sky
And imagine


I'm a spaceman
In another place and time
I guess I'm looking for a brand new place
I remember living in a different life
Is there a better life for me?"
Pop,"Baby, yeah you got me
Baby, yeah you got me
Baby, yeah you got me
Right where you want me
Baby, yeah you got me
Baby, yeah you got me
Baby, yeah you got me
Right where you want me

'Cause you make me want it
just a little too much
And I break open every time we touch
Try to fight it, what's the point if
You, make me want it just a little too
Tell me that you want it too, babe

You make me want it just a little too much
(I want it just a little too much)
And I break open every time we touch
Try to fight it, what's the point if
You make me want it
probably just a little too
tell me that you want it too much
And it's a little too much
And it's a little too much
Hey hey
Tell me that you want it too much, much, oh"
Pop,"Resentment

I wish I could believe him
Ooh, yeah

I wish I could believe you
Then I'd be alright
But now everything you told me
Really don't apply
To the way, I feel inside
Loving you was easy
Once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you
Have multiplied
And it's all
Because you lied

I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can
But I, just can't seem to get over
The way you hurt me
Don't know why you gave another
Who didn't mean a thing, no
The very thing you gave to me

I thought I could forgive you
I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you
Oh it ain't the same, no
As before this woman came

I loved you more than ever
More than my own life
The best part of me I gave you
It was sacrifice
When you broke
Your word that night

I only gave you a hard time
Cos I can't go on and pretend, like
I don't remember feeling
Like I was no good
Like I couldn't do it for you
Like your mistress could
(yeah)

I know she was attractive
But I was here first
Been riding with you for 5 years
Why did I deserve
To be treated this way by you
I know you're probably thinkin'
What's up with me?
This sounds like a 50's record
That's alright with me, yeah

Oh,
ooh,
No, no"
Pop,"Aye, shawty shawty, don't you wanna be mine?

Rock,"Harry was a rich young man
who would become a priest
He dug up his dear father
who was recently deceased

He did it with tarot cards
and a mystically attuned mind
And shortly there
and after he did find

Jeanie was a spoiled young brat
she thought she knew it all
She smoked mentholated cigarettes
and she had sex in the hall

But she was not my kind
or even of my sigh
The kind of animal
that I would be about

Woh-woh-woh, you keep hangin' round me
and I'm not so glad you found me
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
Oh-woh-woh-woh, you keep hangin' round me
and I'm not so glad you found me
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
all right now
ah-huh-huh

Kathy was a bit surreal
she painted all her toes
And on her face she wore dentures
clamped tightly to her nose

And when she finally spoke
her twang her glasses broke
And no one else could smoke
while she was in the room

Hark the herald angels sang
and reached out for a phone
And plucking it with a knife in hand
dialed long distance home

But it was all too much
sprinkling angel dust
To AT and T
who didn't wish you well

Oh, but you keep hangin' round me
and I'm not so glad you found me
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
Ho-ho-ho-ho, you keep hangin' round me
and I'm not so glad you found me
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago

Hangin' round
hangin' round, that's all you're doing baby
Hangin' round
hangin' round, ooohhh
Hangin' round
hangin' round
Hangin' round
hangin' round

Pop,"Listen, 'cause this will be the last time honey
Oh I would, listen
just say the words so I can disappear
'Cause one day I'm all that you need
then you don't text me for two weeks

Don't make it too complicated
Either you leave it or take it
Don't come running back to me

If you're gonna leave, then baby leave for good

I tell myself
Now I have visions
he'll take me off the highest shelf
And I know, and I know, and I know
'Cause one day I'm all that you need
and then you don't text me for two weeks
You think I sit patiently?
Don't make it too complicated

Rock,"i watched the water rise in our house
the rain poured in and washed out our stuff
my father drank from beer bottles
then he'd say
we'll walk on, walk on, what's done, is done
walk on, my son, never let this world drag you down

all that we had was deep in the mud
our photographs and family treasures
my mother drank from beer bottles
then she'd say
we'll walk on, walk on, what's done, is done
walk on, my son, never let this world drag you down

don't let it bring you down (and let your head drop down)
don't let the sun go down (and let your light go out)
don't let yourself fall down
just pick yourself up from the street and get up on your feet

walk on, walk on, what's done, is done
walk on, my son, never let this world drag you down
never let this world drag you down"
Rock,"Wolves in their words
Don't play by their rules

Set the needle down
Take it back to the start
When do we lose
Just how free we are?

Help yourself to what you want
Yeah, caught by the wind
Believing you can fly
Celebrate everything

Sunbathing on the roof
Watching aeroplanes
Believing you can live
Yeah forever in a day
Oh, yeah

Every chain got a broken link
Jump off the boat, you can swim or sink
The swallows dive, through the summer nights
Something beautiful, money just don't buy

Help yourself to what you want
Yeah, caught by the wind
Believing you can fly
Celebrate everything

Sunbathing on the roof
Watching aeroplanes
Believing you can live
Yeah forever in a day

It's never over
There's always time to change
And start again today

Can't forget you

So act like you love me
Love me
Even if it's just tonight
Fuck like you love me

Even if it's just a lie
Yeah I will be there for you
I will care for you
I will die for you
For the night

'Cause I know every part of you
Bringing our secrets into the light

I can't stop checking my phone
Cause maybe you called, maybe you called
I play cool but, everyone knows
I'm falling falling, falling falling

My friends are gonna cloud me
They gonna tell everyone that
I'm whipped whipped whipped, whipped whipped whipped
But I don't even care cause
You make feel like I'm the shit shit shit, shit shit

So here's another love song, woahh
Here's another love song, woahh

But I can't help myself for tryin
to tell myself to slow down, slow down
And I feel like I'm 10 years old
But there's nothing I can do to stop thinking about you,
I'm falling in love and I'm proud

That's when the music takes me
Closer to a brighter daaaay

And the wind brings a cold to tag along

I can almost touch the sky
Reachin' for a new tomorrow

Rock,"I woke up this mornin' with my makeup on
I've been fakin' it lately, but those days are gone
You look at me and wonder why
I got to cut these strings and learn to fly

But the girl is only in your mind
She's leavin' everything behind
She's not the girl that's gonna make it right
So you can kiss that girl goodbye

We're so glad you made it in this dead end town
Everybody's waiting for you to come down
You're gonna wake up from your dream
You're gonna find someone who looks like me

But the girl is only in your mind
She's leavin' everything behind
She's not the girl that's gonna make it right
So you can kiss that girl goodbye

You could look forever for someone like me
She's just a memory

So you can kiss the girl goodbye
Kiss that girl goodbye
So you can kiss the girl goodbye
So you can kiss that girl goodbye

Some are winter sun, ah

Sailors in snow
Send a callout rasing hands
Some are bound to fail

Rock,"The city in defeat,
With no one left to beat,
There's still a fading desire,
To burn a naked light,
Just to defy the night,
Come on and call me a liar.

A crumble tumble down,
In fumble bumble town,
Our lives a ruin,
We reconstruct a bit,
And pretty up a bit,
We hardly know what we're doing.

CHORUS:
But me and my baby,
Make the best of this world,
She's like a diamond,
Innocent girl.
We watch the sign of the times,
Writing on the wall-Cities may fall.

Back through the city fog,
I was another cog,
For the machinery there,
Now the machines have gone,
The silence hanging on,
I sit, I stare.

CHORUS Repeated

Come on and take your aim,
I feel the mildest pain,
Protecting something so rare,
'Cos there's a gem or two.
Inside the human zoo,
If only you are aware.

CHORUS Repeated."

All the pain that he puts you through

Take it from me, it's a lesson to be learned
Even the good guys get burned
Take it from me, see I would give you love
The kind of love that you've only dreamed of

Baby you're not the only one
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love
And I know that you've hurt in the past
But if you want it here's my heart
No Strings Attached

Rock,"Every morning I wake
Dreaming of you
On a window of a lane
By the window of your room

Your long brown locks
Fall across your face
Your memory comes crashing down
Till all my bones break

I call out your name
It echoes in the room
I sleep on the couch
A bed will not do

And I don't wanna let go
Take me back to the start
I will love you while we are learning
To walk in the dark

I write your name in every colour
A flower was made
And bury my face in your memory
Of all my mistakes

In the doorway of the streets
Where you used to stand
And kiss me goodbye
You would hold out your hand

It's starting to rain
On Broadway and Canal
While the radiator rumbles
And the rain's coming down

I don't wanna let go
Take me back to the start
I will love you while we are learning
To walk in the dark

Your fingers still slide
From my wrist to my hand
On our way to the station
In the rain while the traffic's all jammed

Now there's nothing to say
Not even ""goodnight""
I just scribble your name in tears
In the book of my life

You will always be saved
Some place behind my eyes
Where it's always summer
And we laugh in the summertime

I don't wanna let go
Take me back to the start
I will love you while we are learning
To walk in the dark
Walk in the dark
Walk in the dark"

Whit all this jewerly on you
My roof look like a no-show
Got diamonds by the boatload
Come whit the Tony Romo
For clowns and all the bozos

My Ap goin' psycho
Lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody
Whit all this jewerly on you
My roof look like a no-show
Got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend
When I'm rollin through my ends
Though

And I'm like: Woah, see my neck so godamn cold
Diamonds wet my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick won't ever fold
She said: Can't I have some to hold?
And I can't ever tell you no

My Ap goin' psycho
Lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody
Whit all this jewerly on you
My roof look like a no-show
Got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend
When I'm rollin through my ends
Though"
Rock,"Girl I can't abide
By the rules you laid down in this game
'Cause now I've gone and lost myself in you
One time you catch a ride
And it takes you miles away
There's a chance of never feeling blue

And those lonely days will be long time forgotten
If we could find another way
Now let's contemplate is this time of passion
Strong enough to make you stay
Because I do believe in forever
And forever I will stay
And those lonely days will remain
Miles and miles away

Emotional exile
Is the safest way to play
Gotta take a chance every now and then
Irresistible change of heart
I will guide your way
We could share a life again

And those lonely days will be long time forgotten
If we could find another way
Now let's contemplate is this time of passion
Strong enough to make you stay
Because I do believe in forever
And forever I will stay
And those lonely days will remain

Miles and miles away
Miles and miles away
Miles and miles away
Miles and miles away

Miles and miles away....
(Repeat)

Girl I can't abide

Pop,"La, la, la, la... La, la, la, la... Oh... yeah...

I know that it's hard (I know that it's hard)
To see me go (To see me go)
To see me standing so close to the door

I know it's hard when I'm far away
But I promise you when I get back,
I'll stay (I'll stay)...

Close to your hands, close to your legs
Close to the way your body fits on the bed
Close to your hips, close to your lips
Close to the only one I can't resist
Close to your laugh, close to words
Giving you everything I know you deserve
Close to you, baby, close to your world, close to you

La, la, la, la... La, la, la, la... Hey... Mmm

Baby, turn off that frown (Turn off that frown)
Wipe off your face (Wipe off that face)
You know I'm weak to it (So weak)
And you're making me late

Turn off that frown and come over here
(Won't you come over?)
I'm gonna say this like I did before,
Gonna make it crystal clear, when I'm...

Close to your hands, close to your legs
Close to the way your body fits on the bed
Close to your hips, close to your lips
Close to the only one I can't resist
Close to your laugh, close to words
Giving you everything I know you deserve
Close to you, baby, close to your world, close to you

Now you're counting down the days,
There's a picture of your face in my heart
Before you know it, I'll be there
Touching you in ways, so close in all the ways to time apart
So close to you, girl

Close to your hands, close to your legs
Close to the way your body fits on the bed
Close to your hips, close to your lips
Close to the only one I can't resist
Close to your laugh, close to words
Giving you everything I know you deserve
Close to you, baby, close to your world, close to you"
Rock,"Poor girl, no Ma
Nothing much to speak of but a rough diamond
Sleep now and your angels will come, dear
Poor Matilda
Handcuffed to the wheel
And steering wildly
Through love's fields, so blindly

Forever only takes its toll on some
But, tonight you're sleeping alone without him
Tonight you're sleeping alone without him
And everything went up in smoke like wildflowers
Wildflowers, dear

Poor girl, lonely
Shuffles through the parade
Of a sleepless circus serenade
Hold on, dear

Poor girl, no Ma
Sister steals her a coat
For the windless breezes
Sleep now and Jesus will come, dear

Forever only takes it's toll on some
But, tonight you're sleeping alone without him
Tonight you're sleeping alone without him
And everything went up in smoke like wild flowers
Wildflowers, dear

"
Pop,"I was makin my list
I was checkin it twice
In the middle of this, I got tears in my eyes
For in my foolish heart, there was one simple truth
The only gift I wanted was you
I was trimming the tree
I was stringing the lights
While the radio played ""Silent Night""
There were presents you sent
Though there were quite a few
The only gift I wanted was you

(Chorus:)
You need to be home with me
Alone with me
Holding me next to the Christmas tree
Kissing under the mistletoe
As candles glow
Please come home soon
It's not the same without you

As the bitter-sweet night had come to an end
I was saying goodbye to our family and friends
And they all wished me well
And I knew that I knew
The only gift I wanted was you

(Chorus)

Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la la la
Ohhhhh, Ohhhhh
The only gift I wanted was you

(Chorus)

I was makin my list
I was checkin it twice
In the middle of this, I got tears in my eyes
For in my wishful heart, there was one simple truth
The only gift I wanted was you
For in my wishful heart, there was one simple truth
The only gift I wanted was you"
Rock,"
You think that you got it made
While I'm on a holiday
Life of luxury
You feel, so free

You're one of the finest thieves
You got no loyalty
You're king of my garden trees
You feel, so free

Like a Jack in a box
Gotta think like a fox
Get you in my sights and see
Show you one last time down the line, yeah

It's time to run from me
There's no more room for thieves
You had your luxury
So free, be free

I got my sights on you
I'm coming for you soon
I got my eyes on you
Be gone, be gone

Like a Jack in a box
Gotta think like a fox
Get you in my sights and see
Show you one last time down the line, yeah

Like a Jack in a box
I gotta think likе a fox
To get you in my sights and see

Like a Jack in a box
I gotta run like a block
Gеt you in my sights and see
Show you one last time down the line, yeah"
Pop,"Finally blew up in my face
Crash and burnt to pieces
You got what you want from me
I gave you what you needed

I was warned but fooled by charm
And you deserve to be alone

And I deserve better
Better than you
I deserve better
Better than you
I deserve better
(I deserve, I deserve)
Tell 'em what they already know
I deserve better
(I deserve, I deserve)
Tell 'em what they already know
I deserve better

I used to cry to all my friends
But they would say, ""I told ya""
Finally, I can breathe again
The weight is off my shoulders

I was warned but fooled by charm
And you, you deserve to be alone

And I deserve better
Better than you
I deserve better
(I deserve, I deserve)
Better than you
I deserve better
(I deserve, I deserve)
Tell 'em what they already know
I deserve better
(I deserve, I deserve)
Tell 'em what they already know
I deserve better

Let's talk about the word ""deserve""
Or talk 'bout the world deserves a queen
(You queen)
Let's talk about that four letter word: love
I think you deserve a king
I think you deserve the world and everything in it
And I try to go get it to show you I meant it when I
Tell you I'm sorry, tomorrow I promise that I
Try to better, I'll do whatever for mine
And I ain't tryna be your friend's friends
Or your quote unquote fake friend
That's why I hate friends
I'd rather see you laugh to see you cry
I'd rather see you lead and tell a lie
And you ain't gotta say it, you deserve better

And I deserve better
Better than you
I deserve better
(I deserve, I deserve)
Better than you
I deserve better
(I deserve, I deserve)
Tell 'em what they already know
I deserve better
(I deserve, I deserve)
Tell 'em what they already know
I deserve better"
Pop,"When you walk into a room,
Your beauty steals my breath away.
When you look into my eyes,
I find it hard to find the words to say.
Want to run away and hide,
I've just got to let you know.
Feel so tangled up inside,
I should have never let you go.

Anyone can make mistakes,
And we both have made our share,
But a life without your love,
Is a life too hard to bear.
I don't care who's right or wrong,
Only know I love you so.
Why did I have to write this song?
I should have never let you go.

Why?
In all the wide, wide world,
Have I run into you here,
Wish I could disappear.
I'll never understand,
Why I even give a damn.

When you walk into a room,
You know I stand on shaky ground.
I've built so many walls around me,
Now the walls are tumbling down.
You're the kind I can't forget,
Let the tears begin to flow.
I have only one regret,
I should have never let you go.

Should have never let you go,
Should have never let you go,
Should have never let you go.
Should have never let ......you go.

Pop,"Calling all my senses
I can’t see or taste or feel you anymore
And every day I’m calling on my inner strength
To fight for something once worth fighting for
Maybe it’s life in the real world
Maybe it’s all been my fault
What if I go?
What if I leave?
What if I show you how you’re breaking me?
And I know, whatever I say I’ll still be thinking
What if I stay?
Staring at the stars
I make a wish that I could travel back in time
I lie awake just looking at your face
And I remember how you used to look at mine
Maybe it’s life in the real world
Maybe it’s all been your fault
What if I go...
What if I’m sorry?
What if I love you?
What if I go..."
Rock,"I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting that you told me that you
Didn't want me around any more
But these stupid old feet
Just head for your street
Like they've done so many times before
And this stuborn old fist
On the end of my wrist
Keeps a knocking on your front door

I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting bout those heartbreaking nights
And those heartbreaking things
That you said
Though I know in my heart
We're drifting apart
I can't believe that our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head"
Rock,"As he stared past the fire
His hunger to leave well it gnawed his poor heart alive
Her skin smelled like black cherry, blossom perfume,
The sail boats they all sailed by
And a river she cried.

And the wind was suddenly sweeter? than roosevelt pine,
The windows broke out and the cigarette smoke drifted by,
The bums on the bowery were swallowed in the lights
As cars rumbled by in the night
Screaming run for your life.

With cool and silvery eyes
And a heart was fit for desire,
Drowned in a river of tears
Oh a river? she cried left her with a heart
Made of ashes and fire.

One day there was a silence and it washed through the town,
There was no reason to speak and no one made a sound,
Her eyes were indigo and the cats were all calico
And the sail boats they all sailed by
And a river she cried.

With cool and silvery eyes
And a? heart that was fit for desire,
Drowned in a river of tears
Oh a river she cried left her with a heart
Made of ashes and fire
Ashes and fire
Ashes and fire
Ashes and fire"

Pop,"Baby
You got me up all night in bed thinking
About our love, the nights you've been with me
And how I wished that I could reach you through them

Across the globe, you're far away
But your heart stays here with me baby
If I could turn back the hands of time, I would
Freeze the clocks and start all over
I would love you all the way just like I should

Every minute without you it feels like torture
Every minute without you it feels like torture
Every minute without you it feels like torture
Every minute without you it feels like torture
Every minute without you it feels like torture

Baby
I just really need your loving
'Cause I get lost trying to search for something
I hear you calling so I come running
I'm always running back for your heart, baby

Across the globe, you're far away
But your heart stays here with me baby
If I could turn back the hands of time, I would
Freeze the clocks and start all over
I would love you all the way just like I should

Every minute without you it feels like torture
Every minute without you it feels like torture
Every minute without you it feels like torture
Every minute without you it feels like torture
Every minute without you it feels like torture"
Rock,"I got a dirty, dirty feelin'
That I just can't shake
Yeah my brain keeps burnin'
And my body just aches

I know a woman's body is only flesh and bone
A woman's body is only flesh and bone

How come I can't let go?
I'm between two worlds
I said oh yeah, I'm out of my mind
I'm between two worlds

There's a lot of talk about the danger zone
There's adventure novels 'bout takin' to the road

I know a woman's body is only flesh and bone
How come I can't let go?
I'm between two worlds"
Rock,"Saigon, it was all gone
The same coke machines as the streets I grew on
Down in a mesquite canyon, come walking along the ridge
Me and the brothers under the bridge

Campsites an hours walk from the nearest road or town
Theres too much brush in camp for the chp choppers to touch down
Aint lookin for nothin , I just want to live
Me and the brothers under the bridge

Come the santa anas and man that dry brush would light
Jimmy devon got burned up in his own campfire one winter night
We buried his body in the white stone high up on the ridge
Me and the brothers under the bridge

I had enough of the town oh and the straight life
Aint careful you end up on the wrong end of someones knife
Now I want no trouble and I ain't got none to give
Me and the brothers under the bridge

Well I shipped home back in 72
And you know you were just a beautiul light in your moms dark eyes of
Blue
I stepped out on the tarmac, we were just kids
Me and the brothers under the bridge

Come veterans day I sat on the stand in my dress blues
I held your mothers hand, and they passed with the red, white and
Blue
One minute youre right there, and somethin slips..."
Pop,"She was the only one
Of my flesh and blood
Now I have no calling
I can do no worldly good

I sit silent
I sit mourning
I sit listless all the day
I've mostly lost the voice to speak
And any words to say except
Does heaven have enough angels yet?

I've gone hard
And I've gone cold
I can't make the piece of this cracked life fit
Please forgive me for wanting to know
Does heaven have enough angels yet?

She was the only one
Of my own flesh and blood
Sometimes I hear her calling
Straight from the house of god"
Pop,"There's more to you than the fact that you're dark inside
There's more to you than the pain
that you're trying to hide
You say you like to party, that's your choice
But there's a lot more you can say with your voice

You think it's all about what it looks like
You want the world to know what you look like
But what your life is, that's what really counts
Its okay if they find out

You're not okay
You've lost your way
You've got bills to pay
You've had a long hard day
You don't feel right
In this pointless fight
So give it up
This is your life

There's more to you than the fact
that you think you're tough
There's more to you on the days
when you've had enough
I know you wanna push everyone away
But that's only gonna cause you more pain

'Cause you don't have to do everything on your own
You've been going through a lot, all alone
You don't have to feel this forever
You've gotta tell them the truth

You're not okay
You've lost your way
You've got bills to pay
You've had a long hard day
You don't feel right
In this pointless fight
So give it up
This is your life

You're beautiful in more ways than you think
Even when your lips aren't a pretty pink
You're special, you matter
People care that you're not okay

You deserve the love you've been searching for
Lying hopeless on your bedroom floor
Open up that beautiful heart
Let the sun at your face

You'll be okay
You'll find your way
These things will change
You'll have your day

You'll be alright
You'll win this fight
Give up the game
Take back your life

You're beautiful in more ways than you think
Even when your lips aren't a pretty pink
You're special you matter
People care that you're not okay

You deserve the love you've been searching for
Lying hopeless on your bedroom floor
Open up that beautiful heart
Let the sun at your face"
Rock,"When we fall
Into the fire
The flames will burn
Higher and higher

The Moon is full
Thunder and lightning
The engine roars
Burning up the tires

Funny, we don't give a damn anymore
Once we were wild like a summertime storm

So c'mon baby let's just run
The car's waiting outside
Let's burn a hole
Down the middle of the line

So c'mon
The car's waiting outside
We'll disappear without a trace
Let's burn a hole down the middle of the line

Wheels spin round
Like they're preaching to the choir
Rockin' and a rollin'
Burning with desire

Windows down
We're laughing and smiling
Radio's blasting
Blurring with the telephone wires

Funny, we don't give a damn anymore
Once we were wild like a summertime storm

So c'mon baby let's just run
The car's waiting outside
Let's burn a hole
Down the middle of the line

So c'mon
The car's waiting outside
We'll disappear without a trace
Let's burn a hole down the middle of the line

Down the middle of the line
Down the middle of the line
Down the middle of the line"
Rock,"I'm in love with the girl that I'm talking about,
I'm in love with the girl I can't live without.
I'm in love but I sure picked a bad time ...
To be in love, to be in love.

Well, let her be somebody else's queen,
I don't want to know about it.
There's too many others that know what I mean,
And, that's why I got to live without it.


I'm in love with the girl I'm talking about,
I'm in love with the girl I can't live without.
I'm in love but I feel like I'm wearin' it out,
I'm in love but I must have picked a bad time ...
To be in love, a bad time to be in love,
A bad time to be in love, A bad time to be in love.


All the stories coming back to me,
From my friends and the people that I don't want to see.
The things you say I know just couldn't be true,
At least not until I hear them from you.


'Cause I still love the little girl I'm talking about,
I'm in love with the girl I can't live without.
I'm in love but I feel like I'm wearin' it out,
I'm in love but I must have picked a bad time ...
To be in love, a bad time to be in love,
A bad time to be in love, a bad time to be in love.


You know that I love the little girl I'm talking about,
I'm in love with the girl I can't live without.
I'm in love but I feel like I'm wearin' it out,
I'm in love but I must have picked a bad time ...
To be in love, a bad time to be in love,
A bad time to be in love, a bad time to be in love.

Rock,"Toby was alive and feelin' free
Cutin' loose to see what he could see
Searchin' for a friend to share my time
Lookin' for a mountin I can climb
Ain't afraid of death or no voodoo
Do the best that I can do

With the spirit of the wild runnin' free
I got the spirit of the wild inside of me, yea

Angry at the state of world affairs
Angry at the fools that just don't care
This is guaranteed to go no where
Even like a dog, that's been abused
I will never ever loose

I got the spirit of the wild inside of me, yea!

Got the spirit of the wild yea!

Won't believe the lie that time will tell
Gonna tell the world to go to the

Spirit of the wild is runnin' free
I got the spirit of the wild inside of me, yea, yea!
Spirit of the wild, is runnin' free, I got the spirit of the wild
I got the spirit of the wild inside of me, oh yea

Rock,"The embers of the saint inside of you
Are growing as I'm bathing in your glow
I'm swallowing the poison of your flower
And hanging on the rising of my low
Colorful and falling from your mouth
Like a painted fever in recoil
Like a lie without the pain

On a pillow of your bones
I will lay across the stones
Of your shore until the tide comes crawling back

A waning hand on silver granite ways
Will mend my broken limbs and bend my haze
I'm sleeping in the silence of your voice
I'm cradling the peril of my only choice
Colorful and falling from your mouth
Like a painted fever in recoil
Like a lie without the pain

On a pillow of your bones
I will lay across the stone
Of your shore until the tide comes crawling back
Throw my pillow on the fire
Make my bed under the eye
Of your moon until the tide comes crawling back

Even though the truth can burn inside or fall behind
I will wander through your open mind
And you will find no lie can hide
Until the tide comes crawling"
Rock,"Many times I've tried to tell you
Many times I've cried alone
Always I'm surprised how well you
Cut my feelings to the bone

Don't want to leave you really
I've invested too much time
To give you up that easy
To the doubts that complicate your mind

Chorus:

We Belong to the light
We Belong to the thunder
We Belong to the sound of the words
We've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We Belong, We Belong
We Belong together

Maybe it's a sign of weakness
When I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know
What to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit
Do we distort the facts
Now there's no looking forward
Now there's no turning back
When you say

(Chorus)

Close your eyes and try to sleep now
Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best
To try and wash the palette clean
We can't begin to know it
How much we really care
I hear your voice inside me
I see your face everywhere
Still you say

(Chorus)



"
Pop,"Been thinking it over
Been waiting to tell you
Got the sun of your face
Been thinking of you

Can't wait any longer

Gotta get in your mind
Been thinking of you

Welcome

Pop,"Caught in the chaos of lie
Didn’t know my own mind.
Did you?
Did you feel me driffiting away?
If you did, you didn’t say.
Did you?
Locked in a world of your own.
Beyond my control, somehow.
Couldn’t hear what I’m trying to say.
You wouldn’t listen anyway.
Not now

We never really took the time
Only wanna make it right
I wish I didn’t but I
I miss you

If the lines are drawn and the flags unfold,
Would you fight for me or would you be my enemy?
When the conflict calls in this tug of war,
Would you be my strength or would you be my enemy?
If I lose my way on this battle ground,
Will you reach for me or would you be my enemy?
If the lines are drawn and the flags unfold,
Would you fight for me or would you be my enemy?

I can’t breath without you by side
I believed everything we did was right
I can’t hear ‘this is just another fight’
Another fight

We never really took the time
Only wanna make it right
I wish I didn’t but I
I miss you

Everything I wanted to be
Got buried in the history like you

Be my enemy, be my enemy

If the lines are drawn and the flags unfold,
Would you fight for me or would you be my enemy?
When the conflict calls in this tug of war,
Would you be my strength or would you be my enemy?

If the skies run deep, while I gaining ground
And skip to me there’s strenght about, would stand for me or would you be my enemy?
If the skies run deep, while I gaining ground
And skip to me there’s strenght about, would stand for me or would you be my enemy?

I can’t breath without you by side
I believed everything we did was right
I can’t hear ‘this is just another fight’
Another fight

I only wanna make it right
Only wanna make it right
Only wanna make it right
With you."
Rock,"What makes a kettle whistle?
What makes gold precious?
How come some people,
They'll show you everything?
How come some people,
They don't like nothing at all?

Well I know why...
We all want to be...
Beautiful too...
Beautiful too...

What makes a baby cry?
What makes a poor baby
Older than a rich one?
And why do we need to belong,
To someone else?

Well I know why...
We all want to be...
Beautiful too...
Beautiful too...

Rock,"Little white girl
In a shiny black car
Hanging out
With her friends
And doing black tar
Daddy pays
For the wedding
With a fist
Full of dollars
Cost as much
As the state
Of Guatemala

Oh, why
Even try?

Well I got a big car
And a flat screen TV
All my loser friends
And my boyfriend's family
Bring bags of food
And watch
Reality freakshows
Everybody's faking it
But nobody thinks so

Oh, why
Even try?

Got no grease on my hands
Got no serious plans
Whole world's
Waiting for me
'Cause all I gotta do
Is get it for free

Chorus:
Got no reason to bitch
Ain't no parties
I've missed
Got to have it that way
'Cause baby I got
Motivation

Skinny young dude
In a hundred dollar
Tee shirt
In King James kicks
And a brand new manicure
Hotties doing pilates
With the snotties
And the pleasers
Sneaking
In the back door
At Coconut Teasers

Why
Even try?

Well, I dropped
Out of school
When I was seventeen
'Cause I didn't have time
To study my magazines
'Cause there's
A lot to learn
From the privileged few
Like how to build a brand
Wearing high heeled shoes

Oh, why
Even try?

(Repete 3 estrofe)

(Chorus)

I'm gonna own this town (3x)
Yeah, it's all mine

Oh, why
Even try?

She's a high falootin' woman, and she just can't do no wrong.
She's a high falootin' woman, and she just can't do no wrong.
She's gonna' cry some day, and I know it can't be too long.


She's got hips like a honey, and, Lord, she can make 'em move.

Pop,"You were a strange addiction I knew so well
Fear was my condition, you cast your spell
Everything that I thought I knew faded into you and your lies
You will never break me
But you can try, you can try

Do anything you want to me
And don't be feeling bad about your misbehaving heart
Take aim and fire you set me free
Trying to take me down but you will only make me
Stronger, stronger (Stronger)
It only makes me
Stronger, stronger (Stronger)
It only makes me

Maybe I should thank you, you taught me well
How to wear my armour and be myself
In a moment of weakness I could run back to your lies
I am only human
But I can fight, I can fight

Do anything you want to me
And don't be feeling bad about your misbehaving heart
Take aim and fire you set me free
Trying to take me down but you will only make me
Stronger, stronger (Stronger)
It only makes me
Stronger, stronger (Stronger)
It only makes me

I'm not the girl I used to be, I don't need you any longer
Would you be brave enough to cross me now you see me getting stronger

Do anything you want to me
And don't be feeling bad about your misbehaving heart
Take aim and fire you set me free
Trying to take me down but you will only make me
Stronger, stronger (Stronger)
It only makes me
Stronger,oh ohhhh stronger (Stronger)
It only makes me

Your arms look a little stronger
Your eyes just as I remember (oh)
Your smile's just a little softer

And I, yeah
I never prepared for a moment like that
Yeah,in a second, it all came back
It all came back

'cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near
And it was just a quick ""hello""
And you had to go
And you probably will never know
You're still the one
I'm after all these years

Couldn't help but overhear you
Sounds like you're happy with her
But does she kiss you like I kissed you?
Ooh, I wish I loved you
Like I miss you

And I, yeah
I never prepared for a moment like that
Yeah, suddenly, it all came back
It all came back

'cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near

You're still the one

I still feel everything when you are near
And it was just a quick ""hello""
And you had to go
And you probably will never know
You're still the one
I'm after all these years

I never told you
I should've told you
I never told you after all these years
Told you

I never told you after all these years"
Rock,"Itemise the things you
covet as you squander
through your life.
Bigger cars, bigger
houses, term insurance
for your wife.
Tuesday evenings with your harlot,
and on Wednesdays it's
your charlatan analyst,
he's high upon your list.
You got air conditioned
sinuses and dark, disturbing doubts
about religion.
And you keep those cards
and letters going out.
And while your
secretary's tempting you
your morals are exepting
you from guilt and shame,
heaven knows
you're not to blame!

You better take care of
business, Mr. Businessman,
what's your plan?
Get down to business,
Mr. Businessman, if you can
before it's too late,
and they throw your life away.

Did you see your children
growing up today,
and did you hear the
music of their laughter
as they set about to play?
And did you smell the
fragrance of those roses
in your garden?
Did the morning sunlight
warm your soul and
brighten up your day?
Do you qualify to be
alive or is the limit
of your senses
so as only to survive?

Spending counterfeit
incentive, wasting
precious time and health.
Placing values on the
worthless, disregarding
priceless wealth.
Well, you can wheel and
deal the best of them
and steal it from the rest of them.
You know the score,
their ethics are a bore.
86 proof anesthetic crutches
brought you to the top
where the smiles are all synthetic
and the ulcers never stop
when they take that final inventory
yours will be the same
sad story everywhere -
noone will really care. Noone more lonely than
this rich important man.
Let's have your autograph
ENDORSE your epitaph!

You better take care...

Rock,"I am skin and bones, I am pointy nose
But it motherfuckin' makes me try
Makes me try, and that ain't no wrong
I'll tell you why...
There ain't no right!

Ain't no wrong now, ain't no right
Ain't no wrong now, ain't no right
Only pleasure and pain

Motherfuckin' bad wind came, blew down my home
Now the green grass grows
Bad wind came, blew down my home
Goddamn goodness knows!
Where green grass grows there can't be wrong
And goodness knows, there ain't no right!

Ain't no wrong now, ain't no right
Ain't no wrong now, ain't no right
Only pleasure and pain

Bumped my head, I'm a battering ram
Goddamn took the pain
Cut myself, said So what?
Motherfuckin' took the pain
Said So what? I can't be wrong
I thought so but there ain't no right!

Ain't no wrong now, ain't no right
Ain't no wrong now, ain't no right
Only pleasure and pain"

Don't you touch me and act all innocent

And you look at me like that
It's easy to forget
Please don't lie, we got too much to lose
And pretend he means nothing to you
And you could try to make it right
But it's not so black and white
Oh, I've got nothing left

And I've been trying my best to forgive you
But you messed it up one too many times
And when you come to me with tears in your eyes
I can't feel bad this time
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied

And does he love you like the way I did?
And was it worth it the night you spent with him?
How could you go and risk it all?
Blame it on the alcohol
Now you can save your breath
Oh, you can save your breath

And I've been trying my best to forgive you
But you messed it up one too many times
And when you come to me with tears in your eyes
I can't feel bad this time
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied

It doesn't make it any better
When you say, ""It's not my fault""
I really thought I knew you better
Guess I don't know you at all

And I've been trying my best to forgive you
But you messed it up one too many times
And when you come to me with tears in your eyes

Looking for something pretty I could hang on my wall
I knocked over a lamp before it hit the floor I caught it
A salesman turned around
""Boy you break that thing you bought it""

You can look but you better not touch
Mess around and you'll end up in dutch boy
You can look but you better not no you better not no you better not touch

Well I came home from work and I switched on channel 5
There was a pretty little girly lookin' straight into my eyes
Well I watched as she wiggled back and forth across the screen
She didn't get me excited she just made me feel mean

You can look...

Well I called up Dirty Annie on the telephone
I took her out to the drive-in just to get her alone
I found a lover's rendezvous the music low set to park
I heard a tappin' on the window and a voice in the dark

You can look..."

Ardent look, but no heat

We are dancing on broken glass
Can’t stand no more -

Never, never let you go
You are the one I’m searching for
Flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone
Love’s carving it in the stone
Never, never let you go
Return the days we had before
Soul of my soul, blood of my blood
Love’s carving it in my heart

Gentle words, no aim
It seems we’re playing a game
Easy smile, but no fun
Sweet music for no one
Close embrace, but no more
Cold Champagne we forgot to pour
Baby now it has happened with us
We are dancing on broken glass
Can’t stand no more -

Never, never let you go

Flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone

Cause every song and every street
that reminds me of you and me
My friends don't see it but I'm not alright it's getting to me
It's been so long but I can't find a way to move on
This ain't a movie cause the end is not right

And after all this time
I haven't been alright
Since we said goodbye
Cause I, I tried to let go
But I don't know how to move on
And I, I tried to forget you
But I don't know how to move on

Tell me do you look back
and think that I'm just another mistake
While I'm sitting here
still remembering the promises you made
Wish I could tell you what I'm thinking
But baby we're the titanic and we're slowly sinking
The sky's clear the storm has passed
but it's still raining in my head
I try to stop but I can't help replaying every word you said
I'm falling apart more each day
Try to hold onto your memory but I can feel it fade away

And after all this time
I haven't been alright
Since we said goodbye
Cause I, I tried to let go
But I don't know how to move on
And I, I tried to forget you
But I don't know how to move on

How do you just let go when you don't know how
How do you know in time it'll all work out
And how do I know someday I'll be okay
When all I know is how I feel right now
Cause I, I tried to let go
But I don't know how to move on
And I, I tried to forget you
But I don't know how to move on

Cause I, I tried to let go
But I don't know how to move on
And I, I tried to forget you
But I don't know how to move on"
Pop,"Would you be my girlfriend?
Would you be my girlfriend?
Would you be my girlfriend?

Would you be my girlfriend?

He doesn't even know you're there
'Cause he don't love your eyes
And he don't love your smile
Girl you know that ain't fair

In the middle of the night
Is he gonna be by your side?
Or will he run and hide?
You don't know cause things ain't clear

The one to show you where you are

Does he know what you feel (know what you feel?)
Are you sure that it's real (are you sure?)
Does he ease your mind
Or does he break your stride?
Did you know that love could be a shield yeah
In the middle of the night
Is he gonna be by your side?
Or will he run and hide?
You don't know cause things ain't clear

Girl you should be my girlfriend

Ever since I saw your face
Nothing in my life has been the same
I walk around just saying your name
Without you my world would end, yeah
I've searched around this whole damn place
And everything says you were meant to be
My girlfriend... oh

Why don't you be my girlfriend (yeah)
I'll treat you good (uh) I know you hear your friends when they say you should
'cause if you were my girlfriend (my girlfriend)

Girl you should be... my girlfriend (it's destiny)
Girl you should be... my girlfriend
Girl you should be... my girlfriend"
Rock,"You treated me like a schoolgirl lover,
We never did follow any rules.
Into your arms and I'm running for cover,
All of my strings I've tied to you.

So take our things out to the car.
And as the shades of night are fallin'
You're my bright and guiding star.

Rock,"You came to me
In a silver dream
With a glowing flow
Of a mountain stream


You lift my soul
Way beyond the sky
Just to wake me up
With your golden smiles


Chorus:
Silver dreams and golden smiles
Silver dreams and golden smiles
Silver dreams and golden smiles
Silver dreams and golden smiles


I knew one day
You would come my way
You would help me see
The reality


Heaven and earth
They are one, the same
In my heart I know
When you call my name


Chorus


Dreaming when I'm wide awake
See, when my eyes are closed
Flying, I don't need no wings
Being everywhere at once
Hold me, hold me in your arms
Fill me with your glowing grace


"
Rock,"Its time to move on, time to get going
What lies ahead I have no way of knowing
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
Its time to move on, it s time to get going

Broken skyline, movin through the airport
Shes an honest defector
Conscientious objector
Now her own protector

Broken skyline, which way to love land
Which way to something better
Which way to fo rgiveness
Which way do, I go

Its time to move on, time to get going
What lies ahead I have no way of knowing
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
Its time to move on, its time to get going

Sometime later, getting the words wrong
Wasting the meaning, and losing the rhyme
Nauseous adrenaline
Like breakin up a dog fight
Like a deer in the headlights
Frozen in real time
Im losing my mind

Its time to move on, time to get going
Wh at lies ahead I have no way of knowing
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
Its time to move on, its time to get going"
Rock,"I got seven pictures of Buddha
The prophet's on my tongue
Eleven angels of mercy
Sighin' over that black hole in the sun
My heart's dark but it's risin'
I'm pullin' all the faith I can see
From that black hole on the horizon
I hear your voice calling me

Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party
Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party
Tell me how do we get this thing started
Meet me at Mary's place

Familiar faces around me
Laughter fills the air
Your loving grace surrounds me
Everybody's here
Furniture's out on the front porch
Music's up loud
I dream of you in my arms
I lose myself in the crowd

Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party
Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party
Tell me how do you live broken-hearted
Meet me at Mary's place

I got a picture of you in my locket
I keep it close to my heart
It's a light shining in my breast
Leading me through the dark

Seven days, seven candles
In my window lighting your way
Your favorite record's on the turntable
I drop the needle and pray (Turn it up)
Band's countin' out midnight (Turn it up)
Floor's rumblin' loud (Turn it up)
Singer's callin' up daylight (Turn it up)
And waitin' for that shout from the crowd
(Turn it up)
Waitin' for that shout from the crowd (Turn it up)
Waitin' for that shout from the crowd (Turn it up)
Waitin' for that shout from the crowd (Turn it up)
Waitin' for that shout from the crowd (Turn it up)
Waitin' for that shout from the crowd

Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party
Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party
Tell me how do we get this thing started
Meet me at Mary's place

Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain

Make no mistakes now, yeah
Please do excuse my itchy attitude

Why, why are we always asking why
To lamely try to justify for what it is a lack of drive

Calling all the people, have you nothin' brewin'
Time to flap your big fat mouth, let's rap how we be doin'
Say might what you say
That's really all it takes to break through

Where is it at
When your moral is a hat full of money, yeah
Can you explain the messy kitchen sink
Gets so confusing you know

Why, why are we always asking why
To lamely try to justify for what it is a lack of drive

Full-bodied, butt wasted
Loose living, tight-fitting

Superficial expectations

Because this face is free
Maybe next time use your eyes and
LOOK AT ME

Fake money, real plastic
Stupid cupid, fantastic
Queer thinking straight talking
What you see ain't what you are getting
Fast loving, slow moving
No rhythm, but I'm grooving
Old feeling, new beginning
Superficial expectations

Sometimes I don't recognize my own face
I look inside my eyes and find disgrace
My little white lies tell a story
I see it all, it has no glory
Hah (laugh)

Come on and look at me
This face is free
I'm your fantasy
So who d'you wanna be
Not what you see

Countless lovers undercover on the street

You know that I could use somebody
Yeah, you know that I could use somebody
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you (use somebody)

Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep, no
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat

Rock,"Waiting by the side of the road
For day to break so we could go
Down into Los Angeles
With dirty hands and worn out knees

I keep crawling back to you
I keep crawling back to you

The ranger came with burning eyes
The chambermaid awoke surprised
Thought she'd seen the last of him
She shook her head and let him in

Hey baby, there's something in your eyes
Tryin' to say to me
That I'm gonna be alright if I believe in you
It's all I want to do

It was me and my sidekick
He was drunk and I was sick
We were caught up in a barroom fight
Till an Indian shot out the lights

I'm so tired of being tired
Sure as night will follow day
Most things I worry about
Never happen anyway

I keep crawling back to you
I keep crawling back to you"
Rock,"I walked 47 miles of barbwire
Use a cobra snake for a necktie
I got a brand new house on the roadside
Made outta rattlesnake hide
I got a brand-new chimney up on top
Made out of a human skull
Now come on take a little walk with
me honey and tell me who do you love


Chorus:
Who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love


Tombstone hand on graveyard vine
Just 32 and I donâ€™t mind dyinâ€™
I roda a lion to town use a
rattlesnake whip
Take it easy Arlene donâ€™t give me no lip
Who do you love


Chorus


The night was dark
The sky was blue
Down the alley the icewagon flew
Hit a bump somebody screamed
You shoulda heard just what I seen
Who do you love


Chorus


Tombstone hand on a graveyard vine
Just 32 and I donâ€™t mind dyinâ€™
I rode a lion to town use a
rattlesnake whip
Take it easy Arlene donâ€™t give me no lip
Arlene took me by the hand
She said oowee baby you know I understand
Arlene honey letâ€™s raise some sand
Be my woman Iâ€™ll be your man
Who do you love

Rock,"Written by Warren Zevon
c. 1987 Zevon Music/BMI

I was born in '63
Got a little job in the factory
I don't know much about Kennedy
I was too busy working in the factory

We got a kid that's two, we got another one due
We get by the best we can do
The factory's got a good medical plan
And, cousin, I'm a union man
Saying, Yes sir, no sir, yes sir, no sir, yes sir, no sir - Work !

I was born in Mechanicsburg
My daddy worked for Pontiac 'til he got hurt
Now he's on disability
And I got his old job in the factory
Saying, Yes sir, no sir, yes sir, no sir, yes sir, no sir - Work !

Early in the morning I feel a chill
The factory whistle blows loud and shrill
I'd kill my wife or she'd kill me
But we gotta go to work in the factory
Six days a week at the factory
Up early in the morning at the factory
I've been working in the factory
Johnny, I've been working in the factory
Kickin' asbestos in the factory
Punchin' out Chryslers in the factory
Breathin' that plastic in the factory
Makin' polyvinyl chloride in the factory

A light of love, here in the dark

But deep down there's a sweetness
Only you can touch and make me feel
(Oh h h) what a joy
You're such a perfect lover yes
You always know just what to do

I-I I need you...

At the start, I couldn't say
All my feelings I could not portray
But I gotta tell ya now,
That I really need your love, babe
Oh, it's comin' on strong

When you are here beside me
There is nothin' that can bring me down

And you teach me what love is all about

I-I I need you.

Pop,"Look around
Look at the ground
Look at how many want to tear you down
Look at the sky

Or you left your chances behind?

See how many things have changed
See how much you've grown
See how many friends are around you now
See how far you've come
See how many hurdles you won
This is your time to shine
So just memorize

Have you thought
About giving up
But look how many people you forgot
Your choices
Were the best
Or what you sow stood lifeless?
But you took advantage of your opportunities
Or you did not bother try?

See how many things have changed
See how much you've grown
See how many friends are around you now
See how far you've come
See how many hurdles you won
This is your time to shine
So just memorize

Believe in your dream
Leave your mark here
All the effort you made,
Your progress? Can you see?
Dedication
Determination
You can do anything,
You need only believe
Preserve your friends
Live your happy end
Stand out, don't be shy,
Show your talent
This is your chance to start again
A new story will begin

See how many things have changed [laughs]

See how many things have changed
See how much you've grown
See how many friends are around you now
See how far you've come
See how many hurdles you won
This is your time to shine
So just memorize"
Pop,"In this land of accessories
The obsolescent sheen
Like so many fools before us
Lost in dreams

What's behind the curtain
The dinette or the stole
Such important choices
To satisfy the soul

Take it on down to the wishing well
Make a wish to stop your wishing
'Cause you just can't tell
Give it up

The power of suggestion
The tabloids and the tube
Muscles and money
Tits and glory
What's your story

Are we so unhappy
Being what we are
Sly told us a long time ago
Everybody is a star
Give it up"

They Do What They Want and They Go Where They Go
They May Tell You
That You Hold the World in Your Hands
But They Always Give It Back
They Always Give It Back

no Amount of Crying Changes Your Mind
no Amount of Praying Brings You Inside
I Know That You Love Me
and That You Always Will
You Just Stand Outside and Call to Me

With Your Top Hat and Your Scarf
When You Pull Me Through the Rainbow
I Thought You'd Stop
But You Didn't You Turned Around
You Went Back to the Children and Your Music

I Can't Help But Wonder If
Every One in a While You Remember the Girl
When You Were a Homeless Angel
That Drove You Wild
Strange and Elusive

no Amount of Crying Changes Your Mind
no Amount of Praying Brings You Inside
I Know That You Love Me and That You Always Will
You Just Stand Outside and Call to Me

'Bout the things
That satisfy you
It's making me wonder
'Bout the things that
You see in me

Baby what's the deal?
I thought you wanted me for me

You gotta say what you mean
You gotta mean what you say

Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity

I'm glad you're having a good time
Living the life that
I laid out for me
Constantly splurging
Spending my money
On everything you see
It would be different
If you had something,
Maybe like a
J-O-B
You need to
Get your thing together, yeah

You gotta stop running games
It ain't about my fame
Cause you know if things weren't this way
You'd be gone a long time ago, so I say

If I wasn't a celebrity
Would you be so nice to me?
If I couldn't have cheese like everyday
Would you still wanna be with me?
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me?
If I wasn't a celebrity

If you really loved me
You'd try and show me
That it ain't even about my name
But you tried to use me
And lied to fool me
So it can never be the same
So now, I'm, leaving you behind
I've found somebody
Who can love me for me
And that's all I need, yeah, oh

Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity

If I wasn't a celebrity
Would you be so nice to me?
If I couldn't have cheese like everyday
Would you still wanna be with me?
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me?
If I wasn't a celebrity

If I wasn't a celebrity
Would you be so nice to me?
If I couldn't have cheese like everyday
Would you still wanna be with me?
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me?
If I wasn't a celebrity"
Rock,"One soft infested summer me and Terry became friends
Trying in vain to breathe the fire we was born in
Catching rides to the outskirts tying faith between our teeth
Sleeping in that old abandoned beach house getting wasted in the heat
And hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets
With a love so hard and filled with defeat
Running for our lives at night on them backstreets

Slow dancing in the dark on the beach at Stockton's Wing
Where desperate lovers park we sat with the last of the Duke Street Kings
Huddled in our cars waiting for the bells that ring
In the deep heart of the night to set us loose from everything
to go running on the backstreets, running on the backstreets
We swore we'd live forever on the backstreets we take it together

Endless juke joints and Valentino drag where dancers scraped the tears
Up off the street dressed down in rags running into the darkness
Some hurt bad some really dying at night sometimes it seemed
You could hear the whole damn city crying blame it on the lies that killed us
Blame it on the truth that ran us down you can blame it all on me Terry
It don't matter to me now when the breakdown hit at midnight
There was nothing left to say but I hated him and I hated you when you went
away

Laying here in the dark you're like an angel on my chest
Just another tramp of hearts crying tears of faithlessness
Remember all the movies, Terry, we'd go see
Trying to learn how to walk like heroes we thought we had to be
And after all this time to find we're just like all the rest
Stranded in the park and forced to confess
To hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets
We swore forever friends on the backstreets until the end
Hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets

"
Rock,"My life is for life
I'm taking it
Not a day gives way to waste
All my days
I've walked along the line
Like a saint that sins with grace

Roll the dice
Roll the dice
Take a chance
It's in your hands

High as the skyline
I'm balancing
On the edge, on the palm of my hand
No fear of falling
I look down, enjoy the view
Life won't be the same again

Roll the dice

Voice in my head screams out
Nine lives are running out
What goes up must come down
Chances you'll hit the ground
Everything's relative
What you got left to give
Don't you want time to live?
Made up your final wish
Taking another risk
Clenching another fist
Time give those wounds a lick
Teach an old dog new tricks
Luck will run out on you
Black cats in front of you
Mirror just broke in two
Everyone's out to get you

Imagine to feel you're on your own
Life with no family
Feel tomorrow's inferior
It's over
Today
Your show is over
Don't you know
They're out to get you"
Pop,"I talk with a mouth full (uh-huh)

Pop,"This time
I wont show I'm vulnerable
This time
I won't give in first
This time
I will hold out with my love
This time
I will not be hurt

I'm gonna love myself
More than anyone else
I'm gonna treat me right
I'm gonna make you say
That you love me first
And you'll be the one
with the most to lose tonight

This time
I'm gonna keep my heart locked safe inside
This time
I'm gonna be the one
To win your love
your affection
To hide my fear of rejection
This time
"
Rock,"An echo fades of sounds once heard
By thousands brought together for
His ringing voice, a soul that stirred
The faithful to a mighty roar.

For twenty years upon the stage
For twenty years upon the stage
The passion deep within his soul
Brought forth the anger and the rage
His vision locked upon one goal.

The promises of rock and roll could
Break the chains upon his life,
Guitar in hand he vowed he would
Be free from pain and inner strife.

He shook the rafters in the halls
And brought the faithful to their feet,
His river coursed through mighty walls
Across this land, down every street.

With flag unfurled he took the word
Across the seas to hungry youth
Who raised their hands when e'er they heard
His cries for faith, and hope, and truth.

Today he stands with inner peace
A man content with home and health,
Upon his brow a jagged crease
A symbol of success and wealth.

The thunder of his younger days
Has passed, and now his words reveal
A calmer soul in many ways
Fulfilled with satisfactions real.

His arms upraised against the light
He stands alone, his eyes look toward
The ground below, a bird in flight
Still searching for his true reward.

His mission done, he finds retreat
With children and a loving wife,
His body tired from the heat
The price he pays for touring life.

But deep within the longings stir
The music runs within him still,
His passions for the times that were
Are stronger than his iron will.

And all of us who know the man
Will come together when he cries
The message we all understand
The thunder in us never dies.
"
Rock,"You're just a little girl with grey eyes
Never mind, say something
Wait until the crowd cries
Oh, wait until the crowd cries
You're just a little girl with grey eyes

So deep in your room, you never leave your room
Something deep inside of me - yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can you do
What in the world can you do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love
For your love

Oh

I'm just a little bit afraid of you
Cause love won't make you cry
But, wait until the crowd goes
Oh, Wait until the crowd goes
I'm just a little bit afraid of you

So deep in your room, you never leave your room
Something deep inside of me - yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can I do
What in the world can I do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love

Oh, what you gonna say?
Oh, what you gonna do?
Ah, what you gonna be?

To be real me, to the real me
Under the cool, under the cool and under having a ball
What you gonna say to the real me, to the real me
"
Rock,"Oh Billy stares at Cherry in the hall
And walks out into the rain so blessed and tall
Standin' on the corner with a gun underneath his coat
Beneath the stars on the street
Oh on Lexington Avenue they stand
Velvet aces they case the promised land
Reachin' out across the hoods with both hands
Oh, tryin' to catch a ride

Tonight we're lovers in the cold
Running past the graveyards in the snow
Walking in the street with nowhere to go
And it's no, no, no

Oh and the getaway driver waits outside the store
He pulls away just as Billy runs out the door
Oh and Billy won't run anymore, no, no, no

Oh baby I can't lay the stars at your feet
Oh but I think we could take it all, just you and me
Oh come on, you'll see, there's a lot of room
For you baby, in this front seat

Tonight we're lovers on that road (in the snow)
Running past the graveyards in the snow
Walking in the street with nowhere to go
And it's oh, oh, oh
"
Rock,"If you can see me I can see you

I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroads
So take this knife
And meet me across the river

Just shoots and ladders and this is the kiss
American Anna, fantastic Alsatian
From nowhere to nothing
And I go way back

Children swarm like thousands of bugs
Towards the lights the beacons above the hill
The stars to the West, the South, the North and to the East

Now you could say I've got a gift of sorts
A fear of rear windows and swinging doors
A love of violence and dread of sighs

If you can see me I can see you
If you can see me I can see you

I have seen these bairns wave their fists at God
Swear to destroy the beasts, stamping the ground
In their excitement for tomorrow
I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroads
So take this knife
And meet me across the river

I will take your lands and all that lays beneath
The dust of cold flowers, prison of dark of ashes
I will slaughter your kind who descend from belief
I am the spirit of greed, a lord of theft
I'll burn all your books
And the problems they make

If you can see me I can see you
If you can see me"
Pop,"Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said winter love
is spreading everywhere
Summer came and took off with the spring
So now we start the christmas carolines
I'll find my way back home
And light up every tree
We will hang our stockings
for you and one for me
Cause Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said pack your bags
and tell them you'll be late

I'll be home with my love
This christmas
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love
This christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home
I'll be home
I'll be home

Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said wrap the gifts with all your love and care
The wind blow snow up in the sky
But I won't let the wind to lay my flight

I'll be home with my love
This christmas
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love
This christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home
I'll be home
I'll be home

Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said pack your bags and tell them you'll be there

I'll be home with my love
This christmas
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love
This christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home"
Rock,"Standing above me
Is someone who wants to love me
Oh oh where do we go from here

Holding my life in your hands
I want to do what you command oh
Oh oh where do we go from here

I'd never thought I'd want you
As much as I do now
I never thought I'd need you
As much as I do now
But I do now

My life was ending
But with you it's just beginning
Oh oh where do we go from here

Oh oh everything seems so clear
Oh oh now that we've come this far
Where do we go from here

I've made my decision
There will be no more division
Oh oh where do we go from here

Oh oh everything seems so clear
Oh oh now that we've come this far
Where do we go from here

I've made my decision
There will be no more division
Oh oh where do we go from here"
Rock,"She calls on the phone
she says she doesn't want to be alone
She says it's making her neurotic
but please don't mistake it for being erotic

So alone, so all alone

She says let's go for a walk
we'll have a drink and maybe we will talk
And he thinks she has possibilities
if she could just put away her rosary

So alone, nobody wants to be alone

But I just didn't know
I swear to you, I just didn't know
I would never make you sad
if I had known I never would have
said those things to you
you have to be crazy to say those things to you

Let's face it I made a mistake
well you know, fools rush in where angels take a break
I can't be smart all of the time
and anyway I didn't know you were making time over him

To tell you the truth, I forget all about him

And you know, I don't think it's nice
asking one man about another man's vice
I don't care if you pick my head
as long as we end up in bed

Alone, just the two of us alone

I just didn't know
I swear to God, I just didn't know
Can't you understand that it's frightening
when you hear women talking about castrating and hating men
who wants to know about how you hate men

Well, you said now you wanted to dance
so now we're going to dance
You said that you weren't complete
but we're going to put you on your feet
You said that you were very vexed
you told me to forget about sex
You said you liked me for my mind
well, I really love your behind

Oh, get up and boogie, oh baby, get up and dance
Oh, get, get, get, get up and boogie, baby, oh, get up and dance
Shake your booty, mama, oh, get up and dance

Your points very clear
you're not one to cry into your beer
Why don't we go to my place
believe me, I'm very chaste

And I'm so alone, ao all alone

Sure all men are beasts
hey, look, I'll sit here quietly and I'll stare at my feet
I don't blame you for taking umbrage
with animals staring at your cleavage

So alone, we're so all alone

Hey, do you mind if I turn out the light
don't take offense, but why don't you spend the night
I know your passions run very deep
but at this point we both need sleep

So alone, and who wants to be alone

"
Rock,"The way of life is tough these days, it's hard to get along.
But Jesus came and he talked to me, and that's why I wrote this song.
He told me of my brothers in a far and distant land.
He said that it's gettin' crowded on Earth, and it's time we made some plans.
Time we made some plans.


He said overpopulation is the problem of today.
There's too many children on the Earth, and more on the way.
If you don't start some birth control, then you won't last too much longer.
It's best that we let it save our souls, so we can get much stronger.
Get much stronger.


Ahhh ...


I'm afraid of overpopulation.
I don't want to die of suffocation.
The world is full of pollution.
And Jesus is the solution.


He said we're gettin' near the end, and I'm as close as you are.
If you take Jesus as a friend, you're gonna' be a big star.
Star that shiness in the sky above, a light you cannot sever.
You will be with him above, and you will shine forever.
Shine forever.


Ahhh ...


He trys to be with me.
He's tryin to set me free.
He wants to be with you.
So you won't have to die.


"
Rock,"In this world as we know it
sorrows come and go
Now we see the human race
has put its footprints on the moon's face

Satellite's gone up to the sky
But it's not as nice as looking in your eyes

Woh, take it for a little while
no, I could watch it on TV, yeah

Satellite of love, oh, satellite of love
Satellite of love, satellite of

Satellite's gone up to the sky
And it's going to drive me out of my mind

Woh, take it for a little while
no, I can watch it on TV, yeah

Satellite of love, satellite of love
Satellite of love, satellite of

I've been told, baby, you've been bold
to winkin', blinkin' and nod
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
to winkin', blinkin' and nod

Satellite of love, satellite of love
Satellite of love, satellite of

Satellite of love
Satellite of love, it's just a little bit of
A satellite of love

Pop,"Can somebody please explain
to me how I can go from
Feeling fine to just one day
Suddenly
Waking' up feeling
Like I don't have
Much left to give
Anymore
And it feels like I'm falling down now
Harder than the last time
'Cause when my music's gone
That's when I really know
Something's wrong
Something's wrong
And Right now I don't hear a sound

[Chorus]
So tell me how
You can walk away
like nothing has changed
How can you say
This is how it's always been
When the words fall from the page
Nothing stays the same
It's not all right,
Everything has changed

If I can just feel
the same way all the time
all this confusion would finally
leave my mind
And I know there's hope that
I'm feeling inside
Is not a lie, not a lie
'Cause is getting hotter now
to see your face
Getting draker now in so many places
And I'm ready to go now
Ready to leave this all behind
Ad I know that it's the time

[Chorus]
So tell me how
You can walk away
like nothing has changed
How can you say
This is how it's always been
When the words fall from the page
Nothing stays the same
It's not all right,
Everything has changed

And there are times
when I'm not sure
There are time when I'm lost
But so are you
So sing with me now
SIng with me now
Tell me you're out there
'Cause I'm not alone in this
SIng with me now
Sing with me now
Tell me you're out there
'Cause I1m not alone in this
And I can't be alone in this

[Chorus]
So tell me how
You can walk away
like nothing has changed
How can you say
This is how it's always been
When the words fall from the page
Nothing stays the same
It's not all right,
Everything has changed

So tell me how
You can walk away
like nothing has changed
How can you say
This is how it's always been
When the words fall from the page
Nothing stays the same
It's not all right,
It's not okay
It's not all right
It's not all right
Everything has changed"
Rock,"Baby, do you understand me now
Sometimes I feel a little mad
But don't you know that no one alive
Can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems that all I have do is worry
Then you're bound to see my other side
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
If I seem edgy I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has it's problems and I get my share
And that's one thing I never meant to do
Because I love you
Oh, Oh baby don't you know I'm human
Have thoughts like any other one
Sometimes I find myself long regretting
Some foolish thing some little simple thing I've done
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood"
Rock,"Don't tell me
A woman did this to you
Candy lies
Candy lies
Candy lies

You touched my hand
I felt a force
You called it dark
But now I'm not so sure

Just stay awhile
Stay awhile
Stay awhile

Why don't you
Stay awhile
Stay awhile

Stay awhile

Cause your wild card Boy needs playing
Don't believe the lie
Your Dragon needs slaying
Won't you lay here with me
And I will bring
Kisses for the beast

Lay here with me
Here with me

Don't tell me
A woman did this to you
Candy lies
Candy lies
Candy lies

When I look back over
Documents and pages
Ancient savageries

Christened those inflated.
Now it has come to light
The Gods they have slipped up

They forgot about the power
Of a woman's love
Just stay a while
Stay awhile

Stay awhile
Why don't you
Stay awhile
Stay awhile

Stay awhile
Cause your wild card Boy needs playing
Don't believe the lie
Your Dragon needs slaying

Won't you lay here with me
And I will bring
Kisses for the beast
Lay here with me
Here with me

Don't tell me
A woman did this to you

Candy lies
Candy lies
Candy lies
Candy lies
Forgive my
Candy lies

Rock,"
Where are you?
I scan the skies
Voices in the breeze
I scan the sea

Someone said they thought they saw you there
Through a cloud in the Midwest
Then I thought, could it be you?
By the way you were described
""She had the kindest eyes""

Where? Where? Where?
Where? Where? Where?

You told me once
Gardens, yes, they know
Death is not the end and
Flowers burn to gold

Someone said that they saw you there (saw you there)
On a cliff in the Southwest
Then I thought it might be you
By the way you were described
""She had the kindest eyes""

Where? Where? Where?
Where? Where? Where?

Someone prayed you were there for them (once again)
Like a miracle, miracle angel
Now I think it might be true
By the way you were described
""She had the kindest eyes""

Now I know all of it's true
By the way you were described
""She has the kindest eyes"""
Rock,"If you start here late no one will know what you did
No the streets are straight it's the soul that's crooked
I've been treated fine I've been treated elegantly
But I'm not one for bathing in the waters of plenty

East is East West is West
And Bowery is screaming while Delancey rests
Well I'm south of the skating but I'm north of the cash
I could sure use the money but I'm ashamed to ask

The traffic has buried all of last nights rain
The words are all different but the accent is the same

The sun is white and the moon is gray
And the river is black blue and green
The young are young and the old are old
And there are no shades of gray in between

There's at least ten different strains of smoke in the air
And my prints are on them all to prove I was there
And I love the curses but I'm not one for the trenches
And I do love the walking but thank god for the benches

it's hard to tell where green begins and the city gray stops
I guess the trees all bought their armor at second hand shops
My second had is working but the minute hand is broke again
I know time will pass but I don't know when

The sun is white and the moon is gray
And the river is black blue and green
The young are young and the old are old
And there are no shades of gray in between
And there are no shades of gray in between

I know the great ones have been here but where I cant tell
There's dreams here a plenty but they're being withheld
And I'm more impressed with the closed doors than the ones that are open
The whole place tells time by a tower clock tha'ts broken

The pigeons are ravens and the gulls are vultures
And trash is art and cash is culture

The sun is white and the moon is gray
And the river is black blue and green
The young are young and the old are old
And there are no shades of gray in between
There are no shades of gray in between

Pop,"I found the one whom my soul loves
I held him and would not let him go
I found the one whom my soul loves
I held him and I would not let him go

I wanna stay in your arms
I never want to let go
I wanna stay in your arms
I never want to let go

Many waters cannot quench love
Neither can flaws drown it
And it's flashes are flashes of fire
The very light of the lord

Set me as a seal upon your heart
A seal upon your soul
Upon your soul
As a seal upon your heart
A seal upon your soul
Upon your soul

I found the one whom my soul loves
I held him and would not let him go

Rock,"Well you know when you're young there's such a distance between you and your family
You just can't see things from the same point of view

Papa wants a lawyer and mama she wants an author
And all you want is for them to want you

Well, I saw lot of bad signs and we had some real bad times back on the east coast.
And I guess you could say it took California to bring us close
There was a lot of hard livin' and some stone cold women on the east coast
And I saw my papa turn away when I need him most
And California, she's an angel oh so heavenly dressed
And the Pacific she's a woman The Lord must have loved her best
I've got a California rainbow come give them thunder clouds a rest
Oh and the mountain is my friend now, she put me to her test
Well you know every father has dreams and schemes fo his own kid
And dreaming it ain't been declaired no capital crime
But I just hope when I grow up to have my own kids
That I'll love them all I can and let 'em make their own minds
Now you know how a mother can hold the son through understanding
And my father he once held me close by crying
Whoa, and my mama's love it don't ever leave me standing
And papa's love it just leaves me smiling
Whoa, and my mama she's a rainbow,
gotta see hen on Sunday when she's dressed
Whoa, and my papa he's a good man, he gives me and mama his best
Whoa, my mama she's a rainbow, come to give them thunder clouds a rest
And my family is my friend now California put us through her test"
Pop,"[Verse 1]
I get so used to being alone
My choice this time I'm in a zone
Not in a place where you can't control me

Not saying i don't wan't to take a chance
Coz its all open to romance
I know it's crazy but I must say

[Chorus]
It ain't easy being me
It ain't easy don't you know
Coz I'm not the type to let
someone take over me
It ain't easy
(no)
It ain't easy

It ain't easy

It ain't easy
(no)
It ain't easy

[Verse 2]
Wanna have you back down on your knees
Can't give you too much coz I know
Gets to the point where I can't control you

It's like a rush straight to my brain
Feels like I'm driving you insane
In every way coz I can't be contained

[Chorus]
It ain't easy being me
It ain't easy don't you know
Coz I'm not the type to let
someone take over me

Constantly reminded of the place I used to be
Gave up so much energy but now its all about me

Rock,"Whatsoever I've feared has
Come to life
Whatsoever I've fought off
Became my life
Just when everyday
Seemed to greet
Me with a smile
Sunspots have faded
And now I'm doing time
Cause I fell on
Black days

Whomsoever I've cured
I've sickened now
Whomsoever I've cradled
I've put you down
I'm a search light soul
They say but I can't
See it in the night
I'm only faking
When I get it right
Cause I fell on
Black days
How would I know
That this could be my fate

So what you wanted to
See good has made you blind
And what you wanted to
Be yours has made it
Mine
So don't you lock up
Something that you
Wanted to see fly
Hands are for shaking
No not tying

I sure don't
Mind a change
But I fell on black
Days
How would I know
That this could be
My fate"
Rock,"I, I wish I could swim
Like dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever

Oh we can be heroes
Just for one day

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day

I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by wall (by the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day

We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes"
Rock,"I dreamed I was the president of these United States
I dreamed I replaced ignorance, stupidity and hate
I dreamed the perfect union and a perfect law, undenied
And most of all I dreamed I forgot the day John Kennedy died

I dreamed that I could do the job that others hadn't done
I dreamed that I was uncorrupt and fair to everyone
I dreamed I wasn't gross or base, a criminal on the take
And most of all I dreamed I forgot the day John Kennedy died

Oh, the day John Kennedy died
Oh, the day John Kennedy died

I remember where I was that day, I was upstate in a bar
The team from the university was playing football on TV
Then the screen want dead and the announcer said,
""There's been a tragedy
There's are unconfirmed reports the president's been shot
and he may be dead or dying.""

Talking stopped, someone shouted, ""What!?""
I ran out to the street
People were gathered everywhere saying,
did you hear what they said on TV
And then a guy in a Porsche with his radio hit his born
and told us the news
He said, ""The president's dead, he was shot twice in the head
in Dallas, and they don't know by whom.""

I dreamed I was the president of these United States
I dreamed I was young and smart and it was not a waste
I dreamed that there was a point to life and to the human race
I dreamed that I could somehow comprehend that someone
shot him in the face

Oh, the day John Kennedy died
Oh, the day John Kennedy died
Oh, the day John Kennedy died
Oh, the day John Kennedy died

Rock,"Hey blackjack dealer, Hit me man!

Bright lights city gonna set my soul gonna set my soul on fire
I got a whole lotta money that's ready to burn so get those stakes up high
There's a thousand pretty women just-a waiting out there
They're all living just the devil may care
And I'm just a devil with love to spare
So Viva Las Vegas

I wish that there were more than twenty-four hours in a day
Even if there were forty more I wouldn't sleep a minute away
There's blackjack, poker, and roulette wheel
A fortune won and lost on every deal
All you need is money and nerves of steel
Viva Las Vegas

Well viva Las Vegas with the neon flashing
And the walls crashing all your hopes down the drain
Yea viva Las Vegas turning day into nighttime
Turning night into daytime if you seen it once you'll never be the same again

I'm gonna be on the run I'm gonna have me some fun if it costs me my very
last dime
If I wind up broke, well, I'll always remember that I had me a swinging time
I'm gonna give it everything I got
Lady Luck I want you let the dice stay hot
Let me shoot a seven with every shot
Viva Las Vegas

Busted!
Hey man, you going anywhere near Vegas?
"
Rock,"Clap your hands, make a smile
Let me know you hear me
Stay a while, play with me
Long as you are near me
Way to go, straight I know
Love to hear your laughter
Without a care you are there
Together ever after
Me and you cominâ€™ through
Itâ€™s what we got together
Lay it down, make it work
No matter what the weather
We got lotâ€™s of soul, lots of love
Without a thought of givinâ€™ unselfishly
You and me all the love weâ€™re given


See the light
Let it shi-i-i-ine
Let it shine
Down on me
Feeling good
Knew I wou-----ould
Ever since

Pop,"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas just like the ones I used to know,
where the tree tops glisten and children listen to hear
sleigh bells in the snow.

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas with every Christmas card I write,
may your days be merry and bright and may all your Christmases be white.

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas just like the ones I used to know,
where the tree tops glisten and children listen to hear
sleigh bells in the snow.

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas with every Christmas card I write,"
Rock,"Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness
Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun
Conspiring with him how to load and bless
With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run

To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees
And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core
To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
With a sweet kernel, to set a budding more
And still more, later flowers for the bees
Until they think warm days will never cease
For summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells

Who hath not seen oft amid thy store?
Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
Thee sitting careless on a granary floor
Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind
Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep

Drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hook
Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers
And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
Steady thy laden head across a brook
Or by a cyder-press, with patient look
Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours

Where are the songs of spring? Ay, where are they?
Think not of them, thou hast thy music too
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day
And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue

Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
Among the river sallows, borne aloft
Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn
Hedge-crickets sing, and now with treble soft
The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft
And gathering swallows twitter in the skies"
Pop,"There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark,

Finally, I can see you crystal clear,
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your sheet bare,
See how I'll leave with every piece of you,
Don't underestimate the things that I will do,

There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark,

The scars of your love remind me of us,
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all,
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless,
I can't help feeling,

We could have had it all,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
Rolling in the deep,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),
You had my heart inside of your hands,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
And you played it to the beat,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),

Baby, I have no story to be told,
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn,
Think of me in the depths of your despair,
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared,

The scars of your love remind me of us,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
I can't help feeling,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),

We could have had it all,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
Rolling in the deep,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),
You had my heart inside of your hands,

(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
And you played it to the beat,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),

Could have had it all,
Rolling in the deep,
You had my heart inside of your hands,
But you played it with a beating,

Throw your soul through every open door,
Count your blessings to find what you look for,
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold,
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown,

(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
We could have had it all,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),
We could have had it all,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
It all, it all, it all,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),

We could have had it all,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
Rolling in the deep,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),
You had my heart inside of your hands,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
And you played it to the beat,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),

Could have had it all,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
Rolling in the deep,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),
You had my heart inside of your hands,

But you played it,
You played it,
You played it,
You played it to the beat.

Rock,"I lay not sleeping
Don't know what to do
Lay out in waiting
Lord for the noon


Pass so slowly
Time without you
I can't see why
My open eyes can't see


So much to look by
So many things to be
Can't keep looking
In and out of me
She looks at nothing
Someone you all have seen
She never cried
As I watched her leave


Try to help me
Find the change in me
Oh, oh, oh


Try to help me
Find the change in me"

And me, oh God, I'm one.

If I had listened
To what my mother said

But I was young and foolish, oh God,
Let a rambler lead me astray.

Go tell my baby sister
Don't do what I have done.
Go shun that house in New Orleans

Well, I'm going back to New Orleans,
My race is almost run.
I'm going back to spend my life

Rock,"I got so down and out in Frisco
Tired of the pills and the rain
I picked up, headed for sunshine
I left a good thing behind
Seemed all of our love was in vain
My baby's coming in on the Tucson train

I come here lookin' for a new life
One I wouldn't have to explain
To that voice that keeps me awake at night
When a little peace would make everything right
If I could just turn off my brain
Now my baby's coming in on the Tucson train

We fought hard over nothin'
We fought till nothin' remained
I've carried that nothin' for a long time
Now I carry my operator's license
And spend my day just runnin' this crane
My baby's coming in on the Tucson train

Hard work‘ll clear your mind and body
The hard sun will burn out the pain
If they're lookin' for me, tell ‘em buddy
I'm waitin' down at the station
Just prayin' to the five-fifteen
I'll wait all God's creation
Just to show her a man can change

Waitin' on the five-fifteen

While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps"

""Sweet home Alabama""
Play that dead band's song
Turn those speakers up full blast
Play it all night long

Daddy's doing Sister Sally
Grandma's dying of cancer now
The cattle all have brucellosis
We'll get through somehow

""Sweet home Alabama""
Play that dead band's song
Turn those speakers up full blast
Play it all night long

I'm going down to the Dew Drop Inn
See if I can drink enough
There ain't much to country living
Sweat, piss, jizz and blood

Turn those speakers up full blast
Play it all night long

Pop,"Once in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way across town
Wondering to yourself, ""Hey, what've I found?""

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do ......
The best that you can do is fall in love

Arthur he does as he pleases
All of his life, he's mastered choice
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a really good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do .....
The best that you can do is fall in love

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City

If you get caught between the Moon and New York City

Or tells you what to do
She walks away
You're left to stay
Alone

More clouds and rain
You're left forever blue

Forever blue cause you love her
But she doesnt love you
You did your best
Life did the rest
You're left forever blue

No reason left for living
Still theres a lot to do
Old songs to sing
New tears to cry
And feel forever blue
And be forever...
Blue"
Rock,"Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song
I heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh no, don't say it's true

They got a message from the action man
""I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all I needed to love""
Sordid details following

The shreiking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I
ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick...
but the planet is growing

Ashes to Ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out on heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again

I'm stuck with a valuable friend
""I'm happy, hope you're happy too""
One flash of light...but no smoking pistol

I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I've never done anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh

Want an axe to break the ice
Want to come down right now

Ashes to Ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out on heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

My mother said to get things done
You better not mess with Major Tom"
Rock,"I keep listening, very quietly.
You're discussing, your philosophy.
There's a long list, of what's wrong with me.
And you go on talking endlessly.... now

What's the problem?
What's the question?
What's the answer?
Where's this heading?

You keep talking.
Where's it going?
If there's an answer I don't know it...

Please.... You're killing me.
Please.... You're killing me with all these questions.

I've been trying to get along with you.
Doesn't matter what I try to do.
Once you start in.. there's no stopping you... now

What's the problem?

What's the answer?
Where's this heading?

You keep talking.
Where's it going?
If there's an answer I don't know it...

Please.... You're killing me.
Please.... You're killing me with all these questions.

You're explaining, very patiently.
I'm a problem, what to do with me.
I keep listening, but i just don't see now.

What's the problem?
What's the question?
What's the answer?
Where's this heading?

You keep talking.
Where's it going?
If there's an answer I don't know it...

Pop,"The good times are all gone
The night keeps coming on so strong
You cant hold on, no matter what you do
Will there be someone who cares for you
When the blue hour comes?
When the blue hour comes?

And when your restless heart
Tears your world apart
And everywhere you turn
Its falling down on you
Will there be a light that shines for you?

When the blue hour comes for you
If theres anything that you would have me do
Just call on me and Ill be coming through
I will always be there for you
When the blue hour comes
When the blue hour comes

Good times dont last forever
Sometimes its now or never
Darling, reach out for me
You know where Ill be
I will always be there for you
When the blue hour comes
When the blue hour comes for you
If theres anything that you would have me do
Just call on me and Ill be coming through
I will always be there for you
When the blue hour comes
When the blue hour comes"

Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone

Down in Kenya where the Masai roam
And the grass grows tall on the veldt
In our old colonial home
We drank our bitters while the empire fell

Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone

One day the Mau Mau came
All we had was lost
In our old colonial home
Under the Southern Cross

Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone

Down in Kenya where the Masai roam
And the grass grows tall on the veldt
In our old colonial home
We drank our bitters while the empire fell

Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone

The Mau Mau came in '52
The sun went down and we drew the drapes
In our old colonial home
We hid behind the Mau Mau gates

Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone

Rock,"You always were the one that knew
They sold us for the likes of you
I always wanted new surroundings
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat
Trying to remember who to meet
I would take a foxy kind of stand
While tens of thousands found me in demand

When you rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n' roll with me

Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me, I'm out of breath, but not quite doubting
I've found a door which lets me out!

When you rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n' roll with me

Oooo-oo-oo-oo

Oh, when you rock 'n' roll with me,
There's no one else I'd rather be, oh
Nobody down here can do it for me
When you rock 'n' roll with me

When you rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather, I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me

Pop,"You're like perfection, some kind of holiday
You got me thinking that we could run away
You want I'll take you there
You tell me when and where
Oh oh oh oh

But then I asked for your number
Said you don't have a phone
It's getting late now
I gotta let you know
That everybody wants to take you home tonight
But I'm gonna find a way to make you mine

Don't stop doin' what you're doin'
Every time you move to the beat
It gets harder for me
And you know it, know it, know it
And don't stop 'cause you know that I like it
Every time you walk in the room
You got all eyes on you
And you know it, know it, know it

You're coming close now, swear I can taste it
You got me tongue tied, I can't escape it
I'm loving what you got
But then you push me off
Oh oh oh oh
And everybody wants to take you home tonight
But I'm gonna find a way to make you mine

Don't stop doin' what you're doin'
Every time you move to the beat
It gets harder for me
And you know it, know it, know it
And don't stop 'cause you know that I like it
Every time you walk in the room
You got all eyes on you
And you know it, know it, know it

Every day it's the same
Love and games that you play
Back and forth
Round and round, kinda like it this way

Don't stop doin' what you're doin'
'Cause every time you move to the beat
It gets harder for me
And you know it, know it, know it
And don't stop 'cause you know that I like it

Rock,"Tonight we ride, right or wrong
Tonight we sail, on a radio song
Rescue me, should I go down
If I stay too long in trouble town

Oh, yeah, you wreck me, baby
You break me in two
But you move me, honey
Yes, you do

Now and again I get the feeling
Well if I don't win, I'm a gonna break even
Rescue me, should I go wrong
If I dig too deep, if I stay too long

Oh, yeah, you wreck me, baby
You break me in two
But you move me, honey
Yes, you do

I'll be the boy in the corduroy pants
You be the girl at the high school dance
Run with me, wherever I go
Just play dumb, whatever you know

You break me in two

Yes, you do"

Who did it â€” do I care ?

They said he was so high and pure,
They also said that he was cruel.

They killed him, did you see ?
They knew he couldn't take it.
They wanted lies â€” he said the truth.
They did it â€” and it happened â€” who cares ?

I hope he leaves you, hope he cheats on you

I hope you lose your job and every cent
So you ain't got enough to pay your rent
But if you need to, you can stay at mine

'Cause even though you left me broke
Yeah, I still think you're beautiful
And I just keep on runnin' back to you, uh-huh
I hate you more than you could know
But I can't seem to let you go
I still love you no matter what you do, ay

You're the beat in my chest turned to cardiac arrest
I know I'm better off without you, oh
You're the key to my heart and you tore that shit apart
I know I should go find someone new
But I'm not over you

I blocked your number, yeah, I blocked your calls
And all your stupid friends, I blocked them all
But I made a fake page, just to follow you (Oh my god, you creep)
And I've been goin' to the bar you like
I meet a different girl like every night
But all we ever talk about is you

'Cause even though you left me broke
Yeah, I still think you're beautiful

And all I ever hear about is you replacin' me, oh
No matter what I do or where I go
I can't let you go

I?m looking anywhere to try to put my head into

Fall into day dreams inside these walls
I must be out of my mind

Cause I don?t even know you
But all I do is think about your face
And I don?t wanna call you
But I wish I had your number just in case
And I never thought someone could shake me like
you can

I hope you didn?t see
I hope you didn?t notice if you did I hope you
looked away
I?ll keep it all to me
I?ll keep on running cause it?s only when I?m
running that
I feel safe

Of how lucky I am, baby

To understanding baby

The logic of your kind of trust
It amazes me
That someone like you
would care enough
to just believe

Your faith in me
it pulls me through
when there's nothing around
to hold onto
When I fall
when I'm weak
All the strength that I need
is your faith, baby
Your faith in me

Even when I fall
I get along
'Cause our love is real, baby
It's like salvation to my soul
'Cause that's how it feels, baby

It's the sacred thing
That I keep close
To carry on
And I know that I will be alright
In your healing arms

(Your faith in me)
It pulls me through
When there's nothing around
to hold onto
When I fall
When I'm weak
All the strength that I need
is your faith, baby
Your faith in me

You make me feel I can walk on water
(I can reach above the stars)
And nothin' comes against me
Safe within your arms-

(Your faith in me
It pulls me through
When there's nothing around
to hold onto)
When I fall, baby
(When I'm weak
All the strength that I need)
is your faith, baby
Your faith in me

When I fall, baby
When I'm weak, baby
All I need, baby
is your faith in me...

Rock,"She waited by the moon
She was sick with fear and cold
She felt too old for all of this
Of course she never showed
She lugged her suitcase to the bus
Melted home through the snow
North along riverside

She slips beneath the sheets
A husbands quiet devoted wife
But strangers sad and nervous
By the dawns early light
Loves lies like a dead cloud
On a shabby, yellow lawn
Up on riverside

She'll drive the big car
He'll sit behind
She'll keep an eye on Jessica
South along the Hudson

She'll turn the radio high
Find a station playing sad, sad soul
Just a little bit louder now
South along the Hudson yea

Just a little bit faster now
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now
South along the Hudson, yea

And she'll drive the big car
And talk herself insane
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now

Way back when Millennium
Meant racing to the light
He promised her a dream-life
He'd take her back to street-life

Away from violent water
With its Cormorants and leaves
Up on riverside

She'll drive the big car
But he'll sit behind
Bursting her bubbles of Ludlow and Grand
South along the Hudson
She'll turn the radio way up high
Find a station playing sad, sad soul

Just a little bit louder now
South along the Hudson

Just a little bit faster now
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now
South along the Hudson, yea

Just a little bit faster now
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now
South along the Hudson, yea

Rock,"I’d just like to say,
that I remember the day,
that I first woke with you,
Some days I have to admit,
The way we happened to meet,
Was strange, because it was new.

I’m not drinking no more,
Not drinking no less,
Not sleeping at all,
Never in the same bed,
Undressed at the bar,
Engraved bench in the park,
We’d watch them fly Sundays.

Fly, birds round my head again,
Laughed at the words that you said,
I pushed the boat back to you,
I flew from the rain again,
Killed you with what I said,
You already knew.

Not thinking no more,
Not drinking no less,
Not sleeping at all,
Never in the same bed,
Undressed at the bar,
Engraved bench in the park,
We’d watch them fly Sundays.

They say if something should fly away,
And it comes back to you again,
Then it’s yours.

Round and around and around and around we go
Ohh, now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Ohh, now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

Ohh, the reason I hold on
Ohh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light, it's hard to know which one of us is caving

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay, stay
I want you to stay, ohh"

We come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style"
Rock,"Warren Zevon, Zevon Music BMI

We left Constantinople in a thousand ninety-nine
To restore the one True Cross was in this heart of mine
To bring it to Jerusalem and then sail home to Rhodes
We took that holy ride ourselves to know
We took that holy ride ourselves to know

Everyone got famous, everyone got rich
Everyone went off the rails and ended in the ditch
But we had to take that long, hard road to see where it would go
We took that holy ride ourselves to know
We took that holy ride ourselves to know

Now if you make a pilgrimage I hope you find your grail
Be loyal to the ones you leave with even if you fail
Be chivalrous to strangers you meet along the road
As you take that holy ride yourselves to know
You take that holy ride yourselves to know
"
Rock,"It's rainin' but there ain't a cloud in the sky
Must've been a tear from your eye
Everything'll be okay
Funny thought I felt a sweet summer breeze
Must've been you sighin' so deep
Don't worry we're gonna find a way

I'm waitin', waitin' on a sunny day
Gonna chase the clouds away
Waitin' on a sunny day

Without you I'm workin' with the rain fallin' down
Half a party in a one dog town
I need you to chase the blues away
Without you I'm a drummer girl that can't keep a beat
And ice cream truck on a deserted street
I hope that you're coming to stay

I'm waitin', waitin' on a sunny day
Gonna chase the clouds away
Waitin' on a sunny day

Hard times baby, well they come to tell us all
Sure as the tickin' of the clock on the wall
Sure as the turnin' of the night into day
Your smile girl, brings the mornin' light to my eyes
Lifts away the blues when I rise
I hope that you're comin' to stay"
Rock,"When did you becomethe topic of conversation,
When did you become this country's
popular myth
Seems that overnight you caught
everybody's attention
Everybody sings about you and your name
bounces off their lips

When did you become superstar of
this generation
And when did you become commercial property
Everybody's got their own sweet lord,
hear them sing
Looking here, looking there but they just don't
seem sweet

Were you a guru, a godly man,
Or where you a genius, the best in the land

I read in the paper that you were back in fashion
Amongst the famous men you were high on the list
Don't they realise that fashion's a passing fancy

The truth is yesterday, today, forever
you'll be staying
Yesterday, today, forever never wavering
you stated who you were and that will
never change
Like it or not you'll always be the same
Son of God

Like it or not, yesterday, today, forever (x6)
Yesterday, today, forever, like it or not"

Pop,"Virginia Woolf and poetry
No one seemed to notice me
Being young was getting so old
Cheap beer and cigarettes
Life was like a movie set
And I seemed to be given no role

But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 18
I cried to my mother
And she told me, ""young man""

""There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
You don't always have to speak so loud, no
Just be as you are
Life is not always a comfortable ride
Everybody's got scars that they hide
And everybody plays the fool sometimes, yeah
Just be as you are""

They played me on the radio
And everything was changing, so
I thought I was all the way grown
But I can still remember in that cold November
When I realized I'm all alone
But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 22
I cried to my mother
And she told me, ""young man""

""There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
You don't always have to speak so loud, no
Just be as you are
It doesn't matter if you become some star
Life is better when you open your heart
You don't always have to act so hard, no
Just be as you are""

If I'm speaking truthfully
I'm not who I used to be
And I know some people might laugh
Cause my music doesn't sound the same
And my head's no longer shaved
I'm worried if I'm on the right path

But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 26
I spoke to my mother
And she told me, ""young man""

""There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
You don't always have to speak so loud, no

Rock,"Well it's Saturday night in New Jersey
And you're feeling kinda wet
Now the summer heat is getting you worried
So you try to look as innocent as you can as you sweat
And you've got a woman on the other side of the law
But it ain't cool to go see her yet
Because her ex-old man's a city cop
Who thinks he's auditioning for Dragnet
So you stand on the corner looking kinda torn
And in the Blue Light Lounge
Where death was born
The jazz musician blows his horn

You pop a letter to your baby in Richmond
'Cause you're feeling pretty down
She's kinda small but at least she's a rich one
Oh, and she needs you real bad
And sometimes that's all that counts
You had a teenage band and flying hands
And oh, you was pretty big, you were pretty big in the
South
But you passed out on stage and flew into a rage
And someone tried to revive you
mouth to mouth
You felt a pain in your chest
As you passed the crown
And in the Blue Light Lounge
The lights went down
And the audience slipped silently out of town

Well now the atheist he burns you for laughing out loud
Because he can't understand what you're saying
And the word's out when they pushed him in the hole
Everybody knows that he went out praying
Oh, now the park is dark but the sidewalk's bright
And alive with the light of the living
Oh and mama can I walk you home tonight
'Cause it's a big bad city
And this boy's got a lot for the givingI'm stranded in the jungle
First stage witness at a company killing
I'm clutching my high school diploma, shuffling my feet
Promised sixty bucks a week
And guaranteed top billing
Well you can live a life of love in New York
Only if you don't, if you don't love living
And I met this taxi driver who drives me around town
Telling tales of his back seat women

And out on the corner there's no room to move
'Cause everybody's trying so hard to groove
And in the Blue Light Lounge
The jazz musician plays his blues

Pop,"Jive talkin'
You're telling me lies, yeah
Jive talkin'

It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to love
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
And they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
Do, do, do, do
How deep is your love
Do, do
How deep is your
Do, do, do, do
How deep is your love

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man
No time to talk
Music's loud and feeling's warm
I've been doing it right since I was born
But that's all right
That's OK
We can look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a mother or whether you're a brother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'

You gotta make the sacrifice
Somebody's gotta choose
We can make it if we try
For the sake of you and I
Together we can make it right

I try and get some love from up high
There just ain't enough to go around

How you doing bro - is New York
Holding you up, or is it letting you down?
I Have
Missed you all heaps and i've Re-
Planted my feet back in the underground

I'm a hustler
Hustler!
I'll never give up the underground

I came back to pay respect
To another fallen angel
At the old canteen
Someone had to float the cash
To pay up for the wake and so we all agreed

We're all hustlers
hustlers!
We all came up in the underground

I try and get some love from up high
There just ain't enough to go around
Someone had to pay up for the wakes
Taking place down in the underground

I try and get some love from up high
There just ain't enough to go around
Someone had to pay up for the wakes
Taking place down in the underground"
Rock,"Our revels now our ended,
These are actors, as I foretold you,
Were all spirits, and are melted into air,
Into thin air.

And like the baseless fabric of this vision,
The cloud capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
The solemn temples, the great globe itself.

Yea, all which it inherit shall dissolve,
And like this insubstantial pageant faded,
Leave not a rack behind.

We are such stuff as dreams are made of
And our little life is rounded

Pop,"Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air

If I should die before I wake

Losing you is like living in a world with no air
Oh

I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave
My heart won't move, it's incomplete
Wish there was a way that I can make you understand

But how do you expect me
To live alone with just me
'cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gonna be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

No air, air
No air, air
No air, air
No air, air

I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew
Right off the ground to float to you
There's no gravity to hold me down for real

But somehow I'm still alive inside
You took my breath, but I survived
I don't know how, but I don't even care

So how do you expect me
To live alone with just me
'cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

No air, air
No air, air
No air, air
No air, air

It's no air, no air

A girl's allowed to change her mind

And I know it's good enough for me
And what I got, take it from me
Don't get any better
This is it, this is me
I'm exactly where I wanna be

if you accidentally crush it on the ides of March

New York city man, you just say ""go"" and that is that

Brutus made a pretty speech but Caesar was betrayed
Lady Macbeth went crazy but Macbeth ended slain
Ophelia and Desdamona dead leaving Hamlet in a play
but I'm no Lear with blinded eyes, say ""go"" and I am gone

The stars have shut their eyes up tight
the earth has changed it's course
a Kingdom sits on a black knight's back
as he tries to mount a white jeweled horse
While a clock full of butterflies on the hour
releases a thousand moths
You say ""leave"" and I'll be gone
without any remorse
No letters faxes phones or tears
there's a difference between bad and worse

I'm a New York city man, blink your eyes and I'll be gone
New York city - man, M-A-N, you blink your eyes and I'll be gone

New York city, I love you, New York city man
New York city, how I love you, blink your eyes and I'll be gone

Rock,"written by Bruce Springsteen and Warren Zevon 1980 Zevon Music BMI and Bruce Springsteen ASCAP

I was born down by the river where the dirty water flows
And the cold wind cut through me, it cut right through my clothes
And the anger and the yearning, like fever in my veins
Set the fire burning

She came down from Knightstown with her hands hard from the line
From the first time I laid eyes on her
I knew that she'd be mine
Her father was a lawman, he swore he'd shoot me dead
'Cause he knew I wanted Jeannie and I'd have her like I said

Jeannie needs a shooter
Shooter like me
Jeannie needs a shooter
Shooter on her side
Jeannie needs a shooter

We met down by the river, on the final day in May
And when I leaned down to kiss her, she did not turn away
I drew out all my money and together we did vow
To leave that very evening and get away somehow

Jeannie needs a shooter
Shooter like me
Jeannie needs a shooter
Shooter on her side
Jeannie needs a shooter

The night was cold and rainy down by the borderline
I was riding hard to meet her when a shot rang out behind
As I lay there in the darkness with a pistol by my side
Jeannie and her father rode off into the night

Jeannie needs a shooter
"
Rock,"Huh!
I'm outa luck, outa love
Gotta photograph, picture of
Passion killer, you're too much
You're the only one I wanna touch
I see your face every time I dream
On every page, every magazine
So wild so free so far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy

Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh oh, look what you've done

Photograph I don't want your
Photograph I don't need your
Photograph all I've got is a photograph
But it's not enough

I'd be your lover, if you were there
Put your hurt on me, if you dare
Such a woman, you got style
You make every man feel like a child
You got some kinda hold on me
You're all wrapped up in mystery
So wild so free so far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy

Oh, look what you've done to this rock'n'roll clown
Oh Oh, look what you've done

Photograph I don't want your
Photograph I don't need your
Photograph all I've got is a photograph
But it's not enough

You've gone straight to my head"
Rock,"You won't find me, knockin' at your door.
I've known forever, you don't love me no more.
If you don't want to lay there, with your mouth shut tight,
I'm gettin' myself together, yes, I'm leavin' tonight



You ain't gonna' find nobody, to treat you like I do.
I been down on my knees, you treat me like a fool.
Now, I know what you're tryin' to do, awww, it ain't gonna' happen.
'Cause I just done got hip to you, I'm gonna' walk out laughin'.
"
Rock,"Talk-talk, yak-yak
watch you pull that old one track
Get it up and get it back
making it upon your back

No space, no rent
the money's gone, it's all been spent now
tell me 'bout your claim to fame

Now ain't that some claim to fame

Extra, extra, read all about it now
extra, extra, something 'bout a claim to fame
Ooohhh sweet mama, ooohhh sweet mama
something 'bout your claim to fame

Wet lips, dry now
ready for that old hand out, now

Spaced out, spaced in

Now tell me ain't that some claim to fame

Rock,"When the girl in your arms
Is the girl in you heart
Then you have got everything
When you are holding the dream
You have been dreaming you would hold
You're as rich as a king
So hold her tight
And never let her go
Day and night
Let her know
You love her so
With the love of your life
Spend the lifetime of love
Make her yours for evermore

So hold her tight
And never let her go
Day and night
Let her know
You love her so
With the love of your life
Spend the lifetime of love
Make her yours for evermore

That people from bad homes do again and again
It's big and it's bland full of tension and fear
They do it over there but we don't do it here

I knew you for a long time
But I've been thinkin baby that you should know...
Hey hey baby, can we compromise?
I really want you to be mine
I got a million places that we could go

I want to be your everything
I want to be the one you need
So tell me, where you been all my life?
I'm gonna make you mine tonight!

Hey baby you, you've got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
Yeah, you say you're just a friend
Hey baby you, you've got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
Yeah, you say you're just a friend

Hey hey baby, we've been on the phone
Spending time together alone
But every time we talk no words will come out right
Hey hey baby, when I look in your eyes
I can tell you're holding somethin' inside
I've been thinkin' 'bout yo-ou-ou
I've been thinkin 'bout me-e-e

Flo Rida:

In Carol City spent most of my nights
Trying to make the world whistle
But it's a hell of a life
How to make them all get low
Bring it back right around
Let the good times roll
Feeling good right now
But I remember Biz Markie
1989 or maybe 90
Came to me like a song I wrote
Cutting class, chasing you
'Cause you're all I want
Like you, you got what I need
And if not I'll just pretend
Until I can get your friend, I'm playing, though
But baby there's a little truth sprinkle in 'em
Peeking at your eyes and I can see the twinkle in 'em
Thought we'd be together until I seen the wrinkle in them
But I guess not

Hey baby you, you've got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
Yeah, you say you're just a friend
Hey baby you, you've got what I need

Pop,"To an honest man
I could give my body and my soul
With a practiced hand
You could lift me up and make me whole

To the one I love I give the key
And his eyes are stars that shine on me
And I smell the ocean in the dawn
And the bitter times have come and gone

In a gypsy cab
On the Brooklyn Bridge at sunrise
We are going home
And the lust is flirting in your eyes

To the one I love I give the key
And his eyes are stars that shine on me
And I smell the ocean in the dawn
And the bitter times have come and gone
Have come and gone
Have come and gone
Have come and gone

Lalala

In a hotel room
Up above the lights of Tompkins Square
While the music plays
I'm on my way to meet you there

To the one I love I give the key
And his eyes are stars that shine on me
And I'm back where I belong
And the bitter times have come and gone

Lalala

Ooh

To the one I love I give the key
And his eyes are stars that shine on me
Oh shine on me
Oh shine on me
Oh shine... on me
Oh shine on me
Oh shine on me

Shine on me
Oh shine on me"
Pop,"I'm dancing in the rain
Cause there's a fire burning deep inside for you
I'm locked into your chain
Cause I'm addicted to the way your body moves
Oh my heart racing
And my temperature is blazing through the roof
And I'm tired of this sheared
Cause I can't hide the way I'm fiending over you

I'm over whelmed
I might as well stay underneath the spell you put on me
And when you touch me
I can feel it in my veins like electricity

All day I'm only thinking bout you
All day you got me going baby
Always I love the way your body rocks
When we rock you rock with me
Body rock body rock you rock with me
See this is how real love suppose to be
Body rock body rock you rock with me (say)
This is how real love suppose to be
Body rock

Rock,"Every chance, every chance that I take
I take it on the road
Those kilometers and the red lights
Never looking left or right
Oh, but I'm always crashing in the same car

Jasmine, I saw you weaping
As I pushed my foot down to the floor
Round and round the hotel garage
Must have been touching close to 94
Oh, but I'm always crashing in the same car

"
Rock,"It's all I can do
To keep that little girl smiling
And keep my faith alive
Takes all I got to hold on to tomorrow

And you want to make it hard
Yeah, you want to make it hard on me

Some other time
I'd be understanding
You were supposed to be
The friend that I needed when I was down and now

You want to make it hard
You want to make it hard on me

Maybe if I tried, I could turn the other cheek
Maybe, but how big do I have to be

Now you want to make it hard
Yeah, you want to make it hard on me

Maybe if I tried, I could turn the other cheek
Maybe, but how big do I have to be

I need someone
To put their arm around me
Shelter me from all harm
Just as I find something to believe in

You want to make it hard
You want to make it hard on me
Yeah, you want to make it hard
You want to make it hard on me"
Rock,"Once again I've hit the ground
My regrets, I've let you down
That was then, don't you worry
Don't wanna be what you always see
This is me, I'm bittersweet
You wanna leave, but, baby, what's the hurry?
We ain't dead
We ain't done
We've just begun

I know that we've been through a lot
Some was bad, and some was not
You bail me out of all my sorries
You saw it all, you watched me fall
You helped me up as I recall
What went wrong with all my glory?
We ain't dead
We ain't done
We've just begun

No we ain't dead
We ain't done
We've just begun

Well I know that I
I told you lies I sure is true
And I know that I can make you understand
I know that I
Have a lotto prove to you
I know that I can be a better man

We said somethings and clipped our wings
Now we know what sadness brings
Wish that I could change this story
If I stand alone from this day on
All I got is all that's gone
Please, please, please don't leave me
We ain't dead
We ain't done
We've just begun

We ain't dead
No we ain't done
We've just begun

Well I know that I
I told you lies I sure is true
And I know that I can make you understand
And I know that I
Have a lotto prove to you
I know that I can be a better man

No we ain't dead
We ain't done
We've just begun
Yeah

We ain't dead (We ain't dead)
We ain't done (We ain't done)
We just begun

We ain't dead
We ain't done

Rock,"You come for me in the worst of places
You come for me, you come and try to take me home
I'm always in need, and it's hard to be reciprocating
The fabric of our life gets torn

With everything changin', so how am I to know?
How I want to hold on to you when I'm spinning out of
control
You and I together, but only one of us in love
And everybody knows

He says a name, it echoes in my head like it was a
canyon
He says a name, he says it and I know what's up
You come to me sometimes when I'm thinking like a
cannonball shooting out of cannons
And I forget whatever it was I was thinking about

With everything changin', how am I to know?
How I want to hold on to you when I'm spinning out of
control
You and I together but only one of us in love
And everybody knows
Everybody knows
Everybody knows
Everybody knows"
Rock,"I found him by the stage last night, he was breathing his last breath.
A bottle of gin and a cigarette was all what he had left.
Well, I know that you make music 'cause you carry a guitar,
But God help the troubadour who tries to be a star.

Come on and play the chords of love, my friend,
Play the chords of fame,
But if you want to keep your song, do mi, do mi do,
Don't play the chords of fame, oh no, no.

You know I've seen my share of hustlers as they try to take the world
And when they find a melody, they're surrounded by the girls.
But it all fades so quickly like a sunny summer day,
Reporters ask you questions and they write down what you say.

Come on and play the chords of love, my friend,
Play the chords of fame,
But if you want to keep your song, do mi, do mi do,
Don't play the chords of fame, oh no, no.

They'll rob you of your innocence, and put you up for sale.
The more that you will find success, the more that you will fail.
I've been around, I've had my share, and I really can't complain,
But I wonder who I left behind on the other side of fame.

Come on and play the chords of love, my friend,
Play the chords of fame,
But if you want to keep your song, do mi, do mi do,
Don't play the chords of fame, oh no, no.

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm,
Don't, oh don't, don't play the chords of fame.
Don't, oh don't, don't play the chords of fame.
"
Rock,"Legendary hearts
tearing us apart
with stories of their love
their great transcendent loves
While we stand here and fight
and lose another night
of legendary love

Legendary loves
haunt me in my sleep
promises to keep
I never should have made
I can't live up to this
I'm good for just a kiss
not legendary love

Romeo, oh, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo
he's in a car or at a bar
or churning his blood with an impure drug
He's in the past and seemingly lost forever

He worked hard at being good
but his basic soul was stained not pure
and when he took his bow
no audience was clapping

Legendary hearts
tear us all apart
make our emotions bleed
crying out in need
No legendary love
is coming from above
it's in this room right now

And you've got to fight
to make what's right
you've got to fight
to make what's right
You've got to fight
to make what's right
you've got to fight to keep your legendary love"
Rock,"He was lost in a kerosene dream
Fuelled by the urge inside
Always been told not to play with fire
Never was one to abide

It all started way back when
When the neighbor’s house burnt down
Hypnotized by the burning flame
And in that flame his love was found

Now time went on like it always does
No one knew about his love affair
Love it was it’s a twisted game
Now he’s gone with out a prayer

Today he learnt his lesson well
Today he burnt like you do in hell

I wish this tale could end another way
In twisted games we should never play

Now I’ll tell you another tale
About a boy who loved his gun
His 45 was his one best friend
Twisted games that can’t be won

Another day or so they thought
No one knew what was to come
This little town will never be the same
With a little boy who loved his gun

Today he learnt his lesson well
Today he burnt his one last shell

I wish this tale could end another way
Twisted games we should never play"
Rock,"In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping
By a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked ""Why not?"" and I replied ""I don't know""
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped ""KAHLIL GIBRAN""
And I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too

Ho

Oh I said ""So long"" and I waved ""Bye-bye""
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oooooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooooh

He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said ""You'll never go down to the Gods again""
(Turn around, go back!)

He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said ""Do it again, do it again""
(Turn around, go back!)

His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said ""Do it again, do it again""
(Turn around, go back!)

Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
Pop,"Last night I heard the screaming
Loud voices behind the wall
Another sleepless night for me
It won't do no good to call
The police
Always come late
If they come at all

Last night I heard the screaming
Loud voices behind the wall
Another sleepless night for me
It won't do no good to call
The police
Always come late
If they come at all

And when they arrive
they say they can't interfere
With domestic affairs
Between a man and his wife
And as they walk out the door
The tears well up in her eyes

Last night I heard the screaming
Then a silence that chilled my soul
I prayed that I was dreaming
When I saw the ambulance in the road

And the policeman said
""I'm here to keep the peace
Will the crowd disperse
I think we all could use some sleep""

Last night I heard the screaming
Loud voices behind the wall
Another sleepless night for me
It won't do no good to call
The police
Always come late
If they come at all"
Rock,"I know I let you down the last time.
You said then there'd be no next time.
One more chance is all I'm asking.
Is it so hard to be forgiven?

If only I could make you see
how much your love could mean to me.
This time..
This time..

Cause I know the world can turn against you.
But this time I'm gonna be there for you.

I know I said I'd change the last time.
But it won't be the same this time.

If only I could make you see,
how much your love is changing me.
If only we could start again.
This time.
This time.

If only I could make you see.
What one more chance could mean to me.
If only we could start again.
This time.

This time..
This time.
This time.

I know it's gotta work out this time.

"
Rock,"Hey, if you had a message
for the kids today
What would you tell them
If you had the microfone
Yeah, I'd say we're all
somebody from somewhere

Sweet biloxi to New York city
From that fine red wine off a vine
to cheap brown whiskey
Seattle coffee, memphis blues,
chi-town wind, miami cruise
There's a thousand stories 'tween me and you
Give me some love

Yeah, we're all somebody from somewhere
Some mama, some daddy, some love in the air
Some big, some little,

Rock,"One, two, three, four

Blind man wavin' by the side of the road
In a flatbed Ford carryin' a heavy load
Sweet thing sipping on a blueberry wine
On a flat black highway down in Carolina
Black bird slipping in a sky of blue

All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby
All I'm thinkin' about is you, honey
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby
All I'm thinkin' about is you
There ain't nothing in this world I can do about it
All I'm thinkin' about is you

Little boy carryin' a fishing pole
Little girl pickin' huckleberries from off of the vine
Brown bag filled with a little green toad
We hook him through the the lip and throw him off with a line
A sweet pair of legs got me feelin' so blue

All I'm thinkin' about is you
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby

Rain comin' in from over across the road
Big black curtain comin' across the field
Blind will see and lame will be healed
Brown-eyed girl, turn my back on you
Now it's lonely

All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby
And all I'm thinkin' about is you

Pop,"Oo-oo-oh

You are the answer to
One thousand prayers
And I stayed up waiting for you
It was worth all wait, oh

My beloved, my gift from God
I cannot help but say
Oh, Father what a man You have made
Oh, Father what a man You have made

Your heart has become my home
And I want, I want nothing more
Than to love you all of the days of my life
Than to love you all of the days of my life
Oo-oo-ooh

I see you inside out
Your flaws and your scars
And what you'd keep from the world
Has become must to hold

Oh, how beautiful
How simply and
How rare
To be loved and to love you
To be loved and to love you

Your heart has become my home
And I want, I want nothing more
Than to love you all of the days of my life
Than to love you all of the days of my life

Never have I loved another
Never any other
As I've loved you
Never have I loved another
Never any other
As I've loved you
Never have I loved another
Never any other
As I've loved you
Never have I loved another
Never any other
As I've loved you

Cause your heart has become my home
And I want, I want nothing more
Than to love you all of the days of my life (All of the days of my life)
Than to love you all of the days of my life (Days of our lives)

In the day, eyes wide, hearts warm, voices stutter (All of the days of my life)
In a month, one kiss, calm eyes, feeling sacred (Days of our lives)
In a year, pure bliss, hearts filled, resolute eyes (All of the days of my life)
All of the days of my life"
Pop,"All I wanted was a record deal
A couple dollars when I got it
I couldn't understand
Why I still had all my problems
All alone, couldn't find no help
And the stage ain't a good place to find yourself
So I started lifting weights
Hoping if I got bigger
All my confidence would too
Didn't work, go figure
Big ole' chest, hole in my heart
I even bought a chain
With ice to glow in the dark
But it didn't work though
Interrupt my work flow
And them niggas talked shit
And I took it personal
But today, I feel like
Someone answered my prayers
I know it's coming now so it's cool

Let's peel off a layer
To what's underneath
What makes the real me?
I want you to see

Ma ma ma ma ma pain, my struggle
My story, my life
My heart, my spirit
My time, my fight
My flaws, my errors
My god, my life
My heart, my spirit
My time, my light
My light

Light light light
Light light light
Ma ma ma ma ma light
Light light light
Light light light

What is meant to be will be, all the rest we'll see
All the rest we'll see
Had to dream up new dreams
Cause I'm livin out my dreams
Alright
Let's just say it was a new beginning
I followed my heart and now I'm winning winning winning
Like I'm supposed to
Like I'm made for
Sean told me, we still the same brah
All I know is God made me good
At writing songs
If you chase the wrong shit your whole life wrong
But it didn't work though, interrupt your work flow
I was on the wrong path, spinning round in circles
But today I feel like someone answered my prayers
I know it's comin' out so it's cool

Let's peel off a layer
To what's underneath
What makes the real me?
I want you to see

Ma ma ma ma ma pain, my struggle
My story, my life
My heart, my spirit
My time, my fight
My flaws, my errors
My god, my life
My heart, my spirit
My time, my light
My light

Light light light
Light light light
Ma ma ma ma ma light
Light light light
Light light light"
Rock,"If you take a life
Do you know what you'll give?
Odds are you won't like what it Is

When the storm arrives
Would you be seen with me?
By the merciless eyes I've deceived

I've seen angels fall from blinding heights
But you yourself are nothing so divine
Just next in line

(Chorus)

Arm yourself because no one else here will save you
The odds will betray you
And I will replace you
You can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you
It longs to kill you
Are you willing to die?
The coldest blood runs through my veins
You know my name

If you come inside
Things will not be the same
When you return to the night

And if you think you've won
You never saw me change
The game that we have been playing

I've seen those diamonds cut through harder men
Then you yourself but if you must pretend
You may meet your end

(Chorus)

Try to hide your hand
Forget how to feel (forget how to feel)
Life is gone
At just a spin of the wheel (spin of the wheel)

(Chorus)

Pop,"She would not show that she was afraid
But being and feeling alone was too much to face
Though everyone said that she was so strong
What they didn't know was that she could barely carry on

But she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way
Sometimes it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

She would always tell herself she could do this
She would use no help it would be just fine
But when it got hard she would lose her focus
So take my hand and it will be alright
And she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way

Sometimes it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

Sometimes it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

Sometimes it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much"
Rock,"Lightning in the sky
Thunder on the ground
Man and beast alike
Seeking shelter from the storm
All around there is fear in the air
All around there is fear in the air


Burning drops of rain
Flood my thirsty soul
Cold chills to the bone
Glowing eyes filled with pain
All around thereâ€™s a cry no one hears
All around thereâ€™s a cry no one hears


Always on the run
Never taking time to see
Beauty all around
Natureâ€™s dance is just for me
All around, Natureâ€™s dance
Just for me
All around, Natureâ€™s dance
Just for me


Rainbows glowing high
Evening shadows fall
Donâ€™t you wait for me
I wonâ€™t be back for your call


I am free from your spell, I am free
I am free from your spell, I am free
I am free from your spell, I am free
Free, free, free..."
Rock,"Oh no - Oh no - I think it's time for me to run
Well I've been working all the summer - Waiting for the winter to come
And if you feel like reminiscing - well come into the midnight sun
Oh yeah - Oh yeah - I think I've been away too long
Well I've been coming and I'm going - All the time is growing with fun
And if you feel like something's missing - Well come into the midnight sun
Never be a gooseberry for gooseberries should never see it
Drop the one who's looking at you - Looking at the one who's seeing you be it
Oh yeah - Oh yeah - I think I've been away too long
Well I've been waiting all the summer - counting all the trophies I've won
And if you feel like reminiscing - Well come into the midnight sun
Oh no - Oh no - I think it's time for me to run
Well I've been working all the summer - Waiting for the winter to come
And if you feel like reminiscing - Well come into the midnight sun
And if you feel like something's missing - Well come into the midnight sun
And if you feel like reminiscing - Well come into the midnight sun"
Rock,"Solemn faced, the village settles down, undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders, blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some as the night begins for one

Staring through the message in his eyes, lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
gives no indication for the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
pronouncing gross diversion as the label for the dog
oh it's the madness in his eyes as he breaks the night to cry

It's really me
Really you and really me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really you and really me
You'll lose me though I'm always really free

And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud

And the village Dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the Wild Eyed Boy from freecloud

And the women once proud clutched the heart of the crown
As the boulders smashed down from the mountains hand
And the magic in the stare of the Wild Eyed Boy said
Stop, freecloud! They won't think to cut me down

But the cottages fell like the playing card hell
The tears on the face of a Wise Boy
Came trembling down to the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love

Stumbled back to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain track
"
Rock,"Let me sing a song for you
That's never been sung before
All the words were meant for you
And never been said before
She kisses when she sleeps
She kisses when she's sleeping
Let me sing a song for you
A song that's worth the dreaming

Don't waste my time
This is it
This is really happening

What's the use in marigolds
These flowers are for you
All the lights go after burn
The sky it splits in two
I kiss her on her teeth
I kiss her on her teeth, hmm
Let me sing a song for you that alters your belief

Son't waste my time
This is it
This is really happening
"
Rock,"Standing in the shower thinking
About what makes a man
An outlaw or a leader
I'm thinking about power...
The ways a man could use it
Or be destroyed by it
The water hits my neck
And I'm pissing on myself...

Standing
In the shower
Thinking...

Standing in the shower thinking
About a man I know don't like me
He don't like the place I'm headed
Same place he's headed...
I know he'd beat me to it
If he could but he won't do it
But he would man
If he could...
And the water is piping hot..
The water is piping hot
It beats upon my neck
And I'm pissing on myself...

Standing
In the shower
Thinking...

Standing in the shower thinking
Is my woman afraid of me?
She's seen how far I've twisted
It's just cause I can trust her
And ever since we met
She understood so she let
Me twist her good...
I twist her good...
And the water is piping hot
The water is piping hot
It beats upon my neck
And I'm pissing on myself...

Standing
In the shower
Thinking...
"
Rock,"As we've turned these empty pages
I have seen the sweat and pain
Do we have to waste these ages
Going through it all over again?
Let's forget all the dreams we had
Play your dreams of yesterday
When will we ever learn?
When will we turn around?
When will we ever learn?
When will we ever learn?
All that's left now is to keep on hoping
We can change the dice that's cast
I remember how they laughed then
But I knew it wouldn't last
I've tried so hard to close my eyes
But I just can't close my mind
When will we ever learn?
When will we turn around?
When will we ever learn?
When will we ever learn?
One thing's for certain while we're here
One thing's for sure, only the fear
I've tried so hard to close my eyes
But I just can't close my mind
When will we ever learn?
When will we turn around?
When will we ever learn?
When will we ever learn?"
Pop,"If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore

There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
To keep you by my side
And keep you from walkin' out the door

Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
And there'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same
If you walk away, everyday it will rain
Rain, rain-a-a-ain

I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Oooh if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Sayin' there goes my little girl
Walkin' with that troublesome guy

But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Oooh, but little darlin' watch me change their minds
Yea for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'till I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right

Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
And there'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same
If you walk away, everyday it will rain
Rain, rain-a-a-ain

Don't you say (don't you say)
Goodbye (goodbye)
Don't you say (don't you say)
Goodbye (goodbye)
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right

Cause there'll be no sunlight

My eyes will do the same
If you walk away, everyday it will rain

Pop,"I just don't know what to do with myself
Don't know just what to do with myself
I'm so used to doing everything with you
Planning everything for two
And now that we're through

I just don't know what to do with my time
I'm so lonesome for you it's a crime
Going to a movie only makes me sad
Parties make me feel as bad
When I'm not with you
I don't know what else to do

Like a summer rose
It needs the sun and rain
I need your sweet love to beat all the pain

I just don't know what to do with myself
Don't know just what to do with myself
Baby, if your new love ever turns you down
Come back, I will be around
Just waiting for you
I don't know what else to do

Like a summer rose
It needs the sun and rain
I need your sweet love to beat all the pain

I don't know just what to do with myself
I don't know just what to do with myself
So baby, if your new love ever turns you down
Come on back, I will be around
Just waiting for you
I don't know what else to do, no, no, no
I don't know what else to do
I'm still so crazy for you, no, no, no, no
I don't know what else to do, no, no, no, no
I just don't know what to do"
Rock,"Never feel alone
Never feel there's no one there who cares for you
When every door seems closed
Mine is open wide for you

I'll give you strength
Restore your faith
I'm the one who'll be around if it all falls down
I will hold you

I'll be there if you break
I'll be there if you crumble
Come to you if you come undone
Catch you if you stumble
I'll do what it takes
To put the pieces back in place
If you brеak

Never feel ashamed
Nеver feel it's weak if you should reach for me
When you're chained by the pain
I'll be there to set you free

I'll give you love
I'll lift you up
I'm the one who'll be around if it all falls down
I will hold you

I'll be there if you break
I'll be there if you crumble
Come to you if you come undone
Catch you if you stumble
I'll do what it takes
To put the pieces back in place
If you break

But if there comes a time
When I might need someone
Will you be there?
Say you'll be there

Be there if I break
Be there if I crumble
Come to me if I come undone
Catch me if I stumble
I'll do what it takes
To put the pieces back in place
If you break
I'll be there if you crumble
Come to you if you come undone
Catch you if you stumble
I'll do what it takes
To put the pieces back in place
If you break
Oh, if you break
If you break
Hmm"
Rock,"In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings
From the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps
To the old willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries
In a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who's born
On a hot muggy morn
By the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam
Where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats
Only fish heads and tails
And he'll show you his teeth
That have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails
That can swallow the moon

And he yells to the cook
With his arms open wide
""Hey, bring me more fish
Throw it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch
But he's too full to try
So he stands up and laughs
And he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam
You can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants
Grinding women to porch
They've forgotten the tune
That their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night
With the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance
And they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night
With their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow
Underneath the street lamps

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks
And he drinks once again
He'll drink to the health
Of the whores of Amsterdam
Who've given their bodies
To a thousand other men
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue
Their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins
Well he just can't go on
Throws his nose to the sky
And he aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry
On the unfaithful love

In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam

Rock,"Though you've been gone for just a week
It waken me feel so sad to speak
Baby, come back
I miss you

And though before I didn't cry
Now my eyes are never dry
And a thousand jesters
Couldn't make me smile
I miss you, I miss you

And now I know that I was wrong
But it's too late for now you've gone
Baby, come back
I miss you

And though our times were good and bad
Now you're gone I'm always sad
And a thousand jesters
Couldn't make me smile
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you."
Rock,"Baby, I know you cannot hear me now
‘Cause you’re fast asleep
But I love you now
Colors inside your head go spinning around
Like a ferris wheel
Exploding and falling to the ground
Oh, people are screaming, people are screaming
My baby, she’s dreaming
Oh, people are shouting, people are freaking
I’m just staring at the ceiling
Waiting for the feeling
Oh, oh but when she calls,
I know she’s the one
Makes me want her harder
Makes me want to be a little stronger
Still I see monsters
Still I see monsters


Baby, I know you cannot hear me now
‘Cause you’re flying around
At the speed of sound
Colors inside your head go spinning around
Like a ferris wheel
Exploding and falling to the ground
Oh, people are screaming, people are screaming
My babys, she’s dreaming

Oh, people are shouting, people are freaking
I’m just staring at the ceiling
Waiting for the feeling
Oh, oh when she calls
I know that she’s the one
Makes me want it harder
Makes me want to be a little stronger
Still I see the monsters
Still I see the monsters"

Here comes the Ocean
And the waves down by the shore
Here comes the Ocean
And the waves down by the sea
Earth is a hollow hair bought of a bigger head
It nearly drives me crazy
I am a lazy son
I never get things down
...(Unknown)

But here comes the waves
Down by the shore
Washing the eye of the land
That has been down by the sea
Down by the sea
Down by the sea
Down by the sea

Here comes the ocean and the waves
Down by the shore
Here comes the ocean and the waves
Down by the sea

(Incense or In sex or Insects) for evil thoughts, thought of by selfish men
It nearly drives me crazy
I am a lazy son
I never get things done

Here comes the waves down by the shore
Washing the eye of the land that has been down by the sea
Down by the sea

Here come the waves
Here come the waves
Here come the waves

Here comes the ocean
And the waves
Down by the sea
Here comes the Ocean
And the waves
Where have they been?

Silver and black with night
Heres to a summers night
An empty splendid castle
Glowering alone at night
The princess has had a fright
Madness seeks out the lover

And here come the waves down by the shore
Washing the soul of the body
That comes from the depths of the sea

Here comes the ocean
and the waves down by the sea
Here comes the ocean
and the waves, where have they been
Don't swim tonight my love
The tide is out my love
Malcom's curse haunts our family
Oh yes, loud in which, ruler of filthy seas, revelling heavans justice

And here come the waves
And save for a scream
Theres much like a song
To be heard, in the wind, that blows by the sea.

Like the wind

Here come the waves,
Here come the waves,
Here come the waves

Pop,"Oh,
At times I felt like I had lost myself
'cause people try to make you someone else
I had to learn to trust my heart
So things can change

I came to a point
Where I can speak my mind
And not feel
I'm living in a box
To keep the girl I am concealed
Oh
I finally found the strength so I can
Leave that all behind

[Chorus:]
This is my time, to shine
This is my place to find
All that I have inside
I never knew

This is my time to show
What I must have always known
That nothings impossible
And dreams come true

Everybody's got the strength inside
All it takes is time to realize
That you and only you
Can be the one to decide

I can, I will, I know that everything I want
I can do
Believing in my self
Then every wish I make will come true

Oh,
It took a while to get this far
But I'm here now

[Chorus:]
This is my time, to shine
This is my place to find
All that I have inside
I never knew

This is my time to show
What I must have always known
That nothings impossible
And dreams come true

Overcoming all these things
Here I finally found my wings
Now I know I'm ready to fly........

[Chorus x2:]
This is my time, to shine
This is my place to find
All that I have inside
I never knew

This is my time to show
What I must have always known
That nothings impossible
And dreams come true"

I see, trouble deep inside

Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again

Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again

Run, run, baby, run

Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again

Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again

Dream, dream your broken dream
You'll see, the things I never see

Bring back the pain again

Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again

Pop,"If I don't say what you wanna hear
If I don't dress in what you want me to wear
If I don't think the way you do
I can't help it cause that's my truth

If my humor makes you bored
If my religion isn't yours
If my authority doesn't fit my youth
I can't help it cause that's my truth

You see the truth often hurts
But if it's honest it's always worth it
Can't deny that I'm subjective
But no truth can be objective
Even though it's universal
It's always individual
My truth, your truth, his truth, her truth
It doesn't matter as long as it's true

If my culture is something you don't know
Is unfamiliar and uncomfortable
I suggest you get to know my rules
Before you judge me, cause that's my truth

If your opinion is different from mine
If where I say go, is where you draw the line
Even if I may not agree
I will except cause it's your truth and it sets you free

You see the truth often hurts
But if it's honest it's always worth it
Can't deny that I'm subjective
But no truth can be objective
Even though it's universal
It's always individual
My truth, your truth, his truth, her truth
It doesn't matter as long as it's true

Don't you loose your truth
For whatever it's worth
Don't you try to compromise
With your own lies

You see the truth often hurts
But if it's honest it's always worth it
Can't deny that I'm subjective
But no truth can be objective
Even though it's universal
It's always individual
My truth, your truth, his truth, her truth
It doesn't matter as long as it's true

Pop,"And your hands are really shakin something awful
As you light your 27th cigarette
Oh how long have you been sittin in the darkness
You forget
Oh you know you’re gettin really hard to be with
And you’re cryin every time you turn around
And you wonder why you can not pick your head up
Off the ground

Oh my crazy baby
Try to hold on tight
Oh my crazy baby
Don’t put out the light, the light,
the light, the light

And they look at you like they don’t speak your language
And you’re living at the bottom of a well
And you swallowed all the awful bloody secrets
That you can’t tell
Oh you know you ought to get yourself together
But you can not bear to walk outside your door
No, you can not bear to look into the mirror
Anymore, anymore

Oh my crazy baby
Try to hold on tight
Oh my crazy baby
Don’t put out the light, the light,
the light, the light

And your hands are really shakin something awful
As your worries crawl around inside your clothes
Ooh how long will you be sittin in the darkness
Heaven knows

Try to hold on tight
Oh my crazy baby
Don’t put out the light, the light,

Pop,"Deep in the dark there is a light
When I have lost the will to fight
You give the blind a second sight
You keep me up all night

Sometimes the moon
Sometimes the tide
We are the horse
We are the ride
We are the bird
We're taking flight
You keep me up all night

Oh, don't it seem that it's better than a dream
Every time with you is made of gold
Oh, don't it feel nothin's ever been so real
'Cause you take me to the bottom of my soul

You keep me up all night
You keep me up all night
You give the blind a second sight
You keep me up all night

Sometimes a cut
Sometimes a knife
Always the hand that holds my life
You keep me up all night
You keep me up all night

Oh, don't it seem that it's better than a dream
Every time with you is made of gold
Oh, don't it feel nothin's ever been so real
'Cause you take me to the bottom of my soul

You keep me up all night

You give the blind a second sight
You keep me up all night
keep me up all night"

Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know...

The first cut is the deepest
Baby I know
The first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to bein' lucky, he's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, he's worst...

I still want you by my side

Rock,"Nothing bitchy will ever leave my lips
And this tingle in my fingertips
Isn't really
A heart attack
Man on the curb
Breathing heavily
And the fear now
That is eating me
Isn't really
From a heart attack

And this paralysis
Needs no analysis
As I fall apart
At the seams

Feels like centuries
That you have played with me
And in times like this
It escapes me
Why you attack my lead balloon
With your hard attack

And this paralysis
Needs no analysis
As I fall apart
At the seams
From your knockout punch
That floored me with a crunch
To end my unbeaten run
On the scene

Wipe me off the floor
Cut the ground from under me
You wore me like a frock
From a stupid fantasy
We pushed out of bounds
Kicked it from the ground
All 'cause the love we found
Was too tightly wound

I'm in the ocean
I can't feel the ground
And approaching me
Without a sound
Is a thing with attitude
Like a shark attack

And this paralysis
Needs no analysis
As I fall apart
At the seams
From your knockout punch
That floored me with a crunch
To end my unbeaten run
On the scene"
Rock,"(Rod Stewart, Ron Wood)

Woken up on mornings such as this
Thought exactly the same as I'm thinking now.
Every night for a year I've slept alone.
Cold damp room looks worse than me, no no no

Got a fear of death that creeps on every night.
I know I won't die soon, but then again I might,
Water down the drain, I'm wasting away.
Doctors can't help the ghost of a man that's me

Water down the drain goes to the sea,
The pattern of my life keeps a-haunting me.
Moisture from the ocean fills the sky,
Come on down to the ground as the time goes by
I never found out the reason why
My parents had to lie
About the place that I was born
Or from my hometown I was torn
At the tender age of four"
Rock,"It's two A. M. in your car
Windows down, past my street
The memories start

You say it's in the past
And drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
And I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live

Wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

It's two A. M. in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you

We were crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us wanna turn back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
And I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live

Wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore

Wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I wish, I wish, I
I wish, I wish, I

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come rushing
Stand back wasted
I wish you would

I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would

It's two A. M. , here we are
I see your face
Hear my voice in the dark

We were crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
And I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live

Wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
And I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live

Wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore

Wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come rushing
Stand back wasted

I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would

Pop,"There are times
I swear I know you're here
When I forget about my fears
Feelin you my dear

Watching over me
My hope sees
What the future will bring
When you wrap me in your wings

And take me where you are
Where you and I will be together
Once again, we'll be dancin in the moonlight
Just like we used to do
And you'll be smilin back at me
Only then will I be free
When I can be, where you are

And I can see your face
Your kiss I still can taste
Not a memory erased

Oh, how I see your star
Shinin down on me
And I'd do anything
If I could just, be right there where you are

Where you and I will breathe together
Once again we'll be dancin' in the moonlight
Just like we used to do
And you'll be smilin' back at me (you'll be smilin back at me)

Only then will I be free
Then I will be free, so take me where you are

Now baby there are times when selfishly
I'm wishin' that you were here with me
So I can wipe the tears from your eyes and make you see

That every night when you are dreamin'
I'm here to guard you from afar
And anytime I feel alone
I close my eyes and dream of where you are

Where you are

Where you and I will breathe together
Once again we'll be dancin in the moonlight
Just like we used to do
And you'll be smilin back at me (you'll be smilin back at me)

Only then will I be free
Then I will be free,

Baby I still believe
Oh I gotta believe
I still believe
I will touch you that sweet day

That you take me there
Where you are (where you are)
I still believe
Whoooooa, I gotta believe
I still believe
I will touch you that sweet day

That you take me there
Where you are, oh where you are!
I still believe
I gotta believe
I still believe
I'll always be waiting here

That sweet day (that sweet day, yeah!)

I still believe......I still believe...."
Rock,"I never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
I never seen you shine so right
I never seen so many men asking if you wanted to dance
Looking for a little romance, given half a chance
I have never seen a dress you're wearing or the hight lights in your hear like catching rise
i have been blind
Lady in red
is dancing with me
Is nobody here
is just you and me
Is where I wanna be
I hardly know
This beauty by my side
I'll never forget, my love, the way you look tonight
I've never seen you look too god since you've been tonight
I never seen you shine so bright
You were amazing
I never seen so many people wanting be there by your side
And when you turned me and smiled
Took my breath away
I've never have such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete another one
As I do tonight
Lady in red
Is dancing with me
Is nobody here
Is just you and me
Is where I wanna be
I hardly know
This beauty by my side
I'll never forget my love, the way you look tonight
I never will forget the way you look tonight
Lady in red

Rock,"Imagine a still summer's day.
When nothing is moving.
Least of all me.
I lay on my back in the hay.
The warm sun was soothing.
It made me feel good.
The day I met Marie.

The sound of her whisper hello.
Came tiptoing softly into my head.
I opened my eyes kinda slow.
And there she was smiling.
It made me feel good.
The day I met Marie.

With the laughing eyes.
She'd toss her hair and tantalize.
She came to touch me then she's gone
Just like a summer breeze.

I remember her kiss
So soft on my brow
And the way that she said
Baby go to sleep now
Baby go to sleep now

I woke with the chill in the air
The warm sun no longer hung in the sky
I reached out but she was not there
She'd gone where she came from
But I still feel good
To think i've known Marie
With the laughing eyes
She'd toss her hair and tantalize
She came to touch me then she's gone
Just like a summer breeze"
Rock,"Maybe I should go and live in Amsterdam
in a side street near a big canal
spend my evenings in the Van Gogh Museum
what a dream, Van Gogh Museum

Maybe its time to see Tangiers
a different life-style, some different fears
and maybe I should be in Edinburgh
in a kilt in Edinburgh

Doin' a modern dance
doin' a modern dance

Or maybe I should get a farm in southern France
where the winds are wispy and the villagers dance
and you and I we'd sleep beneath a moon
moon in June and sleep till noon

And maybe you and I could fall in love
regain the spirit that we once had
you'd let me hold you and touch the night
that shines so bright, so bright with fright

Doin' a modern dance
doin' a modern dance

Shit, maybe I could go to Yucatan
where women are women, a man's a man
ah, no one confused, ever loses place
with their place in the human race

Maybe I'm not cut out for city life
the smell of exhaust, the smell of strife
and maybe you don't wanna be a wife
it's not a life being a wife

Doin' a modern dance
doin' a modern dance

So maybe I should go to Tanganyika
where the rivers run, down mountains tall and steep
or go to India to study chants
and lose romance to a mantra's dance

I need a guru, I need some law
explain to me the things we saw
why it always comes to this
it's all downhill after the first kiss

Maybe I should move to Rotterdam
maybe move to Amsterdam
I should move to Ireland, Italy, Spain
Afghanistan where there is no rain

Or maybe I should just learn a modern dance
where roles are shifting the modern dance
you never touch you don't know who you're with
this week, this month, this time of year
this week, this month, this time of year

Doin' a modern dance
you don't know who you're with modern dance
I should move to Pakistan, go to Afghanistan
Dance, you don't know who you're with
dance, you don't know who you're with
modern dance
And maybe you don't wanna be a wife
it's not life being a wife
doin' a modern dance
you never touch you don't know who you're with
Dance, modern dance
the roles are shifting dance
you never touch you don't know who you're with
Dance, modern dance
maybe you don't wanna be a wife
it's not a life being a wife

Softly falls the morning rain
Loneliness comes around again
And I sit and sing my song
'Though it never seems to matter
And it never fills the emptiness inside

Frozen notes hang suspended in the autumn air
While someone waits for someone to come somewhere
No one waits for me
'Cause I thought I wanted to be free
Now I'm wondering why I said goodbye
Looking through my window
At the dark and troubled sky
I think I see the ship of the brokenhearted passing by
And I turn away
From today
To where we used to lie
And I cry
Yes, I cry
And I cry
While softly falls the morning rain
Loneliness comes around again

"
Rock,"Kid Rock:

Livin my life in a slow hell
Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sunshine
In three damn days
Been fuelin'up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Lord I wonder if I'll ever change my ways
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her

Sheryl Crow:

I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me somethin' just ain't right
I've been waitin' on you for a long time
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights
I put your picture away
I wonder where you been
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him
I put your picture away
I wonder where you been
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him

Together:

I saw you yesterday with an old friend (Sheryl Crow)
It was the same old same how've you been? (Kid Rock)
Since you've been gone my worlds been dark and grey (Together)
You reminded me of brighter days (Kid Rock)
I hoped you were comin' home to stay (Sheryl Crow)
I was headed to church (Sheryl Crow)
I was off to drink you away (Kid Rock)

Together:

I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you to come back home
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you to come back home
I just called to say I love you, come back home

Rock,"Carpet stained with my red wine
I've been staring at the fire
I keep looking at the time
I'm waiting on you

I can hear the howling wind
Yes the sound is getting higher
As the night is closing in
I'm waiting on you

Those big black eyes wicked smile
That you flash as you walk through my door
Into my life (3x)

Won't you come in and sit right down
Here let me pour a Stolichnaya
Why is it when you come around
I'm waiting on you

We drink until we get too tired
Even though you try to dance for me
I still can't light up your fire
So I'm waiting on you

From time to time I feel so blind
And there's still so much more left to do
Into my life (3x)
All right

You call me on the telephone
You say that I am always busy
So why am I here all alone
Waiting on you

I pick you up in my white car
I could fall ever so easily
Why you keep me hanging on
I'm waiting on you

Still, those big black eyes wicked smile
That you flash as you walk through my door
Into my life (17x)"
Pop,"Close your eyes, close your eyes
And forget all about us tonight

I don't know how to love him
What to do, how to move him
I've been changed, yes really changed
In these past few days, when I've seen myself
I seem like someone else
I don't know how to take this
I don't see why he moves me
He's a man, he's just a man
And I've had so many men before
In very many ways
He's just one more

Should I bring him down?
Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love or let my feelings out?
I never thought I'd come to this
What's it all about?

Don't you think it's rather funny
I should be in this position
I'm the one who's always been
So calm, so cool, no lover's fool
Running every show
He scares me so

I never thought I'd come to this
What's it all about?

Yet, if he said he loved me
I'd be lost. I'd be frightened
I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope
I'd turn my head, I'd back away
I wouldn't want to know
He scares me so
I want him so
I love him so"
Pop,"Stay with me tonight
I'll fill you deep inside
And I'll give you something, want a need for
Just say you'll be with me
For eternity
Baby tell me how you feel, I just need to know,

Is this love
(Is it joy, is it pain, sunshine or is it rain)
Is this love
(Is it joy, is it pain)
Is this love

Give to me your soul
Cause you'll lose your self control
And I'll take you somewhere that you've never been
Lay your feelings bare,
And tell me that you care
Baby show me what you need, I just need to know

Is this love
(Is it joy, is it pain, sunshine or is it rain)
Is this love
(Is it joy, is it pain)
Is this love

(Yeah, hey-ey-ey-hey)
Touch me, hold me, tell me your feelings, then believe

Is this love
(Is it joy, is it pain, sunshine or is it rain)
Is this love
(Is it joy, is it pain, sunshine or is it rain)
Is this love
(Is it joy, is it pain, sunshine or is it rain)
Is this love
(Is it joy, is it pain, sunshine or is it rain)

Is this love
(Know we're together, hold me forever, I'll show you, the key to my heart)
Is this love
(Know we're together, hold me forever, baby, lets make a start)

Rock,"Hello Gracie, you're a good little girl
It's a beautiful world, knowing you're out in it
Last time I saw you playing in the yard
You were running with children and the old people were smiling

Do you miss me would you know me at all?
If you walked by my house would you smile and turn the corner
I'll blow you kisses, only make you feel worse
You know you've gotta make the best of the time god has given you

I scratch your name into a wall on the beach with my keys into the side of the pier
I used to sleep so I would dream I was lying with you midsummer
In the grass, in the fields

Nobody was right, nobody was wrong
But somebody had to go
Nobody appears so nobody is gone
Hello, goodbye, hello
Hello, hello, hello
Oh

I scratch your name in my arm with my keys on the beach on the side of the pier
I keep your picture in a frame on the wall of my place down the block
far enough away, it's like I'm not here

You're in my heart and you're in my soul
So I have to let you go
You're in my heart and you're in my soul
But I gotta let you go
Hello, hello, hello, hello
I gotta let you go
Hello, hello, hello
I gotta let you go
I gotta let you go

Deep in your eyes.
A kind of pale jewel
Open and closed
Within your eyes.
I'll place the sky
Within your eyes.

There's such a fooled heart
Beatin' so fast
In search of new dreams.
A love that will last
Within your heart.
I'll place the moon
Within your heart.

As the pain sweeps through,
Makes no sense for you.
Every thrill is gone.
Wasn't too much fun at all,
But I'll be there for you-ou-ou
As the world falls down.

Falling.
As the world falls down.
Falling.
Falling in love.

I'll paint you mornings of gold.
I'll spin you Valentine evenings.
Though we're strangers 'til now,
We're choosing the path
Between the stars.
I'll leave my love
Between the stars.

As the pain sweeps through,
Makes no sense for you.
Every thrill is gone.
Wasn't too much fun at all,
But I'll be there for you-ou-ou
As the world falls down.

Her mind is racing, she plans, she plots, she schemes.
Another idea.

She takes apart the past and re-writes all her lines.
She's tried to win him back a hundred different times,
She's got another idea.

She keeps waiting, hoping he'll come back some day,
She'll leave me, until she does I can say.
Wait, please don't go,
I've got another idea.

No fun to be the one that love is practiced on,
Why should I leave her she wouldn't know I've gone

Rock,"Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head you feel left out
or looked down on.
Just try your best,
Try everything you can.
And don't you worry what they tell themselves
When you're away.

It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride.
Everything, everything will be just fine,
Everything, everything will be allright, allright.

Hey, you know they're all the same.
You know you're doing better on your own,
so don't buy in.
Live right now.
Yeah, just be yourself.
It doesn't matter if it's good enough
For someone else.

It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride.
Everything, everything will be just fine,
Everything, everything will be allright, allright.

It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride.
Everything, everything will be just fine,
Everything, everything will be allright.

Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your mind you feel left out
or looked down on.
Just do your best,
Do everything you can.
And don't you worry what their bitter hearts
Are gonna say.

It just takes some time,
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride.
Everything, everything will be just fine,
Everything, everything will be allright.

It just takes some time,
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride.
Everything, everything will be just fine,
Everything, everything will be allright."
Rock,"I wish I found some better sounds
no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told when I get older
all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure
and I care what people think

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time
to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep
but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time
to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep
but now we're stressed out

We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell
will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one

It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown
a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes
we all would take the latter

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time t

When our momma sang us to sleep
but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time
to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep
but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend
give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship
and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space
but now they're laughing at our face
Saying: Wake up, you need to make money, yeah

We used to play pretend
give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship, and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space

Used to play pretend
used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up
you need the money
Used to play pretend

We used to play pretend
wake up, you need the money

Pop,"Where do I go from here, tell me baby
If I can't have you near
I've been running in circles for you
Gotta fever of a hundred and two
Can't fake how I feel for you

This foolish heart of mine, gets frustrated
Can't read between the lines
And the signal that I'm waiting for
Is always locked behind the door
And it makes me want you more

So let your love shine down on me
And I will surrender
Wear my heart upon your sleeve
Just put your trust in me and I will be there forever
So let your love shine down on me

If I could have my way, I'd take you baby
Out every night and day
You're the battery to my heart
And without you I can't start
Don't you leave me in the dark


You know I wanna believe, I wanna see the light, so let your love shine down on me
You know I wanna believe, I wanna see the light, so let your love shine down on me
You know I wanna believe, I wanna see the light, so let your love shine down on me
You know I wanna believe, I wanna see the light, so let your love shine down on me"

Let me buy you a wedding ring,
Let me hear the choir sing,
Oh you pretty thing.

You pretty thing,
Let me walk you down the aisle,
Darling, it’s where our love is found,
Oh you pretty thing.

Let me kiss you gentle,
Squeeze and hold you tight,
Let me give all my love,
The rest of my life.

You pretty thing,
Let me hold you by my side,
And become my blushing bride,
You pretty thing,
Pretty thing,
Let me dedicate my life,
You will always be my wife,
Oh you pretty thing."
Rock,"I remember yesterday and I’d sit and watch the hound dogs play
Howlin’ at the china moon
? ? now yesterday is the busted blues
Life was young, things were easy,
Days were short, nights were warm
Time were good. hate was shallow
? ? the horse crazy behind the ? ? ? ?
I swear that I’ve seen your face somewhere back in that time
And I’m in theat place. do you remember?
The old house stood like world war two with just rooms
And a hall to be used.
The lady was mean.
Just slightly unclean with a heart of cold silver and gold.
Kitchen smelled of kerosene.
Celing hung down on ? veil? and rotted beams
And the man, they said, his work could of hung in the room
Now he sits around all day because his left arm won’t move
He was a master of the art of electricity
He lectured on tours and circuitry.
He was self-employed, but he could never see his way into the light
He had a room full of switches and dials and lights and
A head full of clouds and eyes full of sight.
And when it got dark,
I could hear his heartbeat like a mother in the night.
She stood like a guardian ready to give everything up.
If I had asked for a sword and her blood in a cup.
But there was just time when I asked for too much.
She sighed because she could not give it.
We used to sit beneath the tree just the lady, the radio man and me.
And I think it was the winter of ’63 the man went away and let us be
It was early on an august day that the lady decided she must go away.
Her heart it seems could not pay the price for what her body was buying
I came home from school and I found the note went into the kitcken
And lit the old stone with songs set on overload.
I turned on the tv, spent the rest of the sfternoon watching
All my cartoons thru the hall
And across the porch was the sun surrendered like a crying torch."
Rock,"Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do

I was riding on the e-train
I was whistling to the rhythm
I was thinking about my live-in
I was feeling pretty fine
I asked the time
Got a poke in the eye

When I read the latest news
How we can't believe he wore those shoes
Should we have the man impeached
Or should we shoot him in the foot
Well you waste my time
You waste my time
Looking for two hundred ways to hang a guy

Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do

Allegations
Interrogations
Investigations
Then more taxation
National past time is aggrivation
I think I'll move out to a desert isle
Just for a while

To avoid all that's distracting
Like newspapers and magazines
Insipid propagandizing
To tell me what a loser I've elected
But you've neglected to tell the truth
That your politics is tied around his foot
And we too are dangling

Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do

Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do

Do you think that we are crazy
Low I.Q., that we are lazy
That we sit here watching sitcoms
That we have no clue to what is going on
Well you got that wrong

Wait and see, the boom will fall
The morning eggs will hit the wall
And everyone I know will call
To say that change is hanging in the air
You'd best beware
You'll wake up and Average Joe is in your chair
Just because he'd kinda like to do what's right
But more cause all you politicians do is fight

Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do

Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do

Couldn't help myself
Hid my past from you

Long over that and
You can believe it

If not today then
Why make your promises
A love declared for days to come
Is a good as none

You can wait' til morning comes
You can wait for the new day
You can wait and lose this heart
You can wait and soon be sorry

Now love's the only thing that's free
We must take it where it's found
Pretty soon it may be costly

If not now what then
We all must live our lives
Always feeling
Always thinking

With a Nashville Shaketown band
I've been playing the blues so long
I've been paying my dues so long
I've been traveling in the lightning
Traveling in the lightning
Traveling in the wind and the rain
I've been tryin' and tryin' to find the right place again . . yeah

Now the last time I saw my sweet old mama,
Her eyesight was looking dim
And the last I saw of my dear old daddy,
His horse was aridin' him . . yes he was
They've been singing the blues so long
They've been singing such a sad, sad song
They've been traveling in the lightning
Traveling in the lightning
Traveling in the wind and rain
They've been tryin' and tryin' to find the right place again . . yeah

I don't need your rings of gold
Or the secrets that you hold

I don't need your sacred vow
Or the promise tomorrow brings
There, behind the morning clouds
I'll take the faith the daylight brings

Lift me up, darling
Lift me up and I'll fall
With you lift me up
Let your love lift me up

When the morning bright
Lifts away this night
And the light above
We will find our love
We will find our love

Your skin, your hand upon my neck
This skin, your fingers on my skin
This kiss, this heartbeat, this breath
This heart, this heart, this wilderness

Lift me up, darling
Lift me up and I'll fall
With you lift me up
Let your love lift me up.

Pop,"Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Sitting, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah we'll be counting stars

I see this life like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and you shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told

I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Sitting, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Sitting, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars

I feel the love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is a four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told

I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that downs me makes me wanna fly

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Sitting, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Sitting, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons are learnt

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons are learnt

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons are learnt

Take that money
Watch it burn

Everything that kills me
Makes feel alive

Rock,"It was hit and run when ya took my heart away
Nothin' you could do to change my mind
Nothin' you could say to make me stay
Here I go alone,into the night
(chorus)
I can't live with ya
I can't live without your love
I can't live with ya
I can't live without your love
You terrorize my dreams at night
I crave your touch to chase my blues away
And nothin I could say to make ya stay
Here I go again,into the night
(chorus)
I can't live with ya
I can't live without your love
I can't live with ya
I can't live without your love
I try and try to change my mind
There ain't much hope
Now ain't no time
The situations got the best of me
Awwww yup....

Nothin' I could say
To make me stay
Here I go again
Into the night
Here we go baby.....

Pop,"It's a fairytale I can't explain
Full of words I don't know how to say
And without a little twist of fate
I know I'd still be searching, baby
I swear that you've been sent to save me
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to

It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you

And you've seen all my darkest fears
Like you've known me for a thousand years
The boy who's really underneath
All the scars and insecurities, baby
I swear that you've been sent to save me
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to

It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to

It's always been you, yeah
It's always been you
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to"
Pop,"Maybe I remind you of a lover you had
Maybe I'm crazy and I make you laught
Maybe you thought I had a lot of cash
I don´t care what it was
But I love what it does

I really dig that your apartment's a mess
I dig the way the sun shines through your dress
I did your industrial shoes
I could say I'm kinky I guess
I can´t believe my luck
You're such a fabulous fabulous mmm

I'm walking in Avalon
And drunk on everything
Her hero in Avalon
A man who would be king

It's cool we both like Bogart and Bacall
It's cool that I like John and you like Paul
Baby it's cool forever cool that your spirit is free
And still you've chosen me

I'm walking in Avalon
And drunk on everything
Her hero in Avalon
A man who would be king

Remenber those mushrooms down in Mexico
How we found our clothes I'll never know
Baby I hope I've loved you the way that you have loved me
A toast to Guinevere
Let's fill our grail with one more beer

I'm walking in Avalon
And drunk on everything
Her hero in Avalon
A man who would be king

We're walking in Avalon
Alive is anything
Two heroes in Avalon
So let the sirens sing"
Rock,"She slept on an iron bed lived through the war for what?
Butterflies round the fire smiled
Smiled until she's robbed of all she's got

I heard the innocent got shot today
Grandma died on poppy day
I heard the dress downed got turned away
All died, died on poppy day

Fancy dress in a dress down town
Happy halloween
Door breaks open lost and walked in
Killing the happy scene

I heard the innocent got shot today
Grandma died on poppy day
I heard the dress downed got turned away
Old dad died on poppy day

I heard the innocent got shot today
Grandma died on poppy day
I heard the dress downed got turned away
Old dad died on poppy day
On poppy day

Rock,"I've got this good lookin' woman back home, let me tell ya'
She cooks good and she looks good, and she just can't do no wrong.
She cooks me cornbread in the morning, she's my dinner and my midnight snack.
She sits up and she begs, and she even rolls over on her back.


CHORUS
Please don't tell me that's the way that it goes, 'cause I've tried hard and I know.
I ain't been playin' in your back yard, 'cause I got my baby and she loves me so.


She don't treat me mean, and she loves my machine, yeah.
I digs her 'cause she's funky, and she sure keeps it clean, now.
I'm a loafer, she's my chauffeur, and she sure likes to drive me, uh-huh.
I lay my life on the line, and she steps right up besides me, yeah.


CHORUS


I don't have to sing the blues no more.
A girl like mine is hard to find for sure.
She lays it on me each and every night.
She's my pleasure and my world's delight.


I don't have to sing the blues no more.

Rock,"Days can be lonely
Night lets you down
Wonder and wander
There's no one around
Nothing to say now, nothing to do
I can feel my heart breaking
And it's all 'cause of you

Nothing to say now, nowhere to hide
I can feel my heart breaking
All the love left inside

Each time I've called you,
You said we were through
All that I wanted is to be with you
There's nothing to show now, nowhere to go
Nothing to tell you,
You don't love me no more
Nothing to say now, nowhere to hide
I can feel my heart breaking
All the love left inside

But if in your heart, you could love me too
Let me come back home
I can change for you
If you ever find, that you miss me too
If you want me back
I'll be there for you
Days can be lonely
Days can be lonely

Daytime is lonely
Night gets me blue
Nothing to say now, nothing to do
Nothing to say now, nothing to show
I can tell you don't love me, you don't want me no more
Nothing to say now, nothing to do
Oh, my heart it was breaking
I've been praying for you
So if in your heart, you can find a way
Just to take me back, let me try again
Oh, if in your heart, you could say it's true
Let me come back home, I'll be there for you
Days can be lonely
Days can be lonely
Days can be lonely
Days can be lonely

Pop,"Super cool, you're moving slowly closer
you never take your eyes off me
you bring it on as you start the conversation
and you ask me casually....

Are you single?
happy with your wash?
you need a chaperone?
are you in a rush?
(you say) can i call a cab to take you home? (uh-oh)


here comes the Hustler
i see you're slick at that sweet-talk thing
tryin to win me over
full marks for tryin, but you'll never get my love
here comes the Hustler
he's a pro at the chit-chat thing
tryin to win me over
full marks for tryin, but you'll never get my love
oh no, oh no, oh no, oh nooooo

did the boys wind you up
and did they dare you?
then mark your progress one-to-five?
me and my girls been watching you slide over
a hunter on the trail tonight


Are you single?
happy with your wash?
you need a chaperone?
are you in a rush?

here comes the Hustler
he's a pro at the chit-chat thing
tryin to win me over
full marks for tryin, but you'll never get my love

i seen it all before and boy there is no way
i know your type and i know you like to play
you're flauting it and you shimmy up here
panic attack when you get too near to the ladies
with your lyrical flow
try'un to impress with the ""come on let's go""
to the boys can i dedicate this
you are a fool to persist

Are you single?
happy with your wash?
you need a chaperone?
are you in a rush?
(you say) can i call a cab to take you home? (uh-oh)

here comes the Hustler
i see you're slick at that sweet-talk thing

Rock,"We should be together for Christmas
Together with the ones we love
The ones we care for
We should be together for Christmas
And be there with the ones we love
And not be far away
That's why they invented planes
So we could fly away
To the ones we love
And be there for this day

We should be together for Cristmas
It isn't right to be apart
We could be here wild in our wishes
With all the love that's in my heart
I want you to be here
That's why they invented trains
So you could ride away
To the one you love
And be here for this day
We should be together

And it never matters where
Anyplace... we don't care
Long as we both are there

That's why they invented stars

I got no need for Cars
Just a wish and I could be there
Where you are"
Rock,"You want me to leave, you want me to stay
You ask me to come back, you turn and walk away
You wanna be lovers, and you wanna be friends
I'm losing my patience, you're nearing the end
One of these days you're gonna reach out and find
The one that you count on has left you behind
Don't want to be no martyr, with no one, no say
Oh my, my baby, before it's too late

Treat Me Right
Treat Me Right
Open your eyes, maybe you'll see the light

Do you think I'm a fool, well you better think twice
I've had enough baby, it's time you realized
That you can't have it both ways, it's no way to live
You've done all the takin', it's your turn to give

One of these days you're gonna reach out and find
The one that you count on has left you behind
Don't want to be no martyr, with no one, no say
Oh my, my baby, before it's too late

Treat Me Right
Treat Me Right
Open your eye's, maybe you'll see the light
Ooh, Ooh, Treat Me Right

You want me to leave, you want me to stay
You ask me to come back, you're turnin' love away
You wanna be lovers, and you wanna be friends
I'm losing my patience, you're nearing the end

Treat Me Right
Treat Me Right
Open your eyes, maybe you'll see the light
Ooh, Ooh, Treat Me Right

Treat Me Right - Treat Me Right
Treat Me Right - Treat Me Right
Treat Me Right - Treat Me Right
Treat Me Right - Treat Me Right
Treat Me Right (Fading Out)

Pop,"While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don't follow through
Cause my heart belongs to Daddy

If I invite a boy some night
To dine on my fine finnan haddie
I just adore, his asking for more
But my heart belongs to Daddy

Yes, my heart belongs to Daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to Daddy
Da, Da, Da, Da, Da, Da, Da, Da, DAAAAD

So I want to warn you laddie
Though I know that you're perfectly swell
That my heart belongs to Daddy
Cause my Daddy, he treats it so well
"
Rock,"I was born right here on Randolph St. in Freehold
Here, right behind that big red maple in Freehold
Well, I went to school right here, got laid, and had my first beer in Freehold
Well, my folks both lived and worked right here in Freehold
I remember running up the street past the convent and church here in Freehold
Chased my daddy down in these bars, first fell in love with this guitar
here in Freehold

Well, I had my first kiss at the YMCA canteen on Friday night
Maria Espinosis tell me where are you tonight?
You were 13 but way ahead of your time, I walked home with a limp but I felt
fine that night in Freehold
Well, the girls at Freehold Regional they looked pretty fine
had my heart broke at least a half dozen times
I wonder if they miss me, if they still get the itch
if they'd dump me if they knew I'd strike it rich
straight out of Freehold

Well, Tex rest in peace, and Marion gave us kids a hand in Freehold
George and I started up a little rock and roll band in Freehold
Well, we learned pretty quick how to rock, I'll never forget the feeling
of that first 5 bucks in my pocket that I earned in Freehold
I got outta here really hard and fast in Freehold
Everyone wanted to kick my ass back there in Freehold
Well, if you were different, black or brown
it was a bit of a red neck town back then in Freehold

Well, something broke my daddy's back in Freehold
In '69 he left and he never come back to Freehold
Said, once he drove to California, 3000 miles in 3 days
called my relatives some dirty names and drove straight out of Freehold
My sister had her first little baby at 17 in Freehold
Well, people they can be pretty mean
Honey, you had a rough road to go, but you ain't made of nothin' but soul
I love you more than you'll ever know
We both survived Freehold

Well, my buddy Mike, he's the mayor now in Freehold
I remember when we used to have a lot more hair in Freehold
Well, I left and swore I'd never walk these streets again, Jack
Tonight all I can say is, holy shit I'm back, back in Freehold
Well, this summer everything was green in Freehold
Rode my kids on the fire engine through the streets of Freehold
I showed 'em where daddy was born and raised, and first felt the sun on his
face
there in Freehold
I still got a lot of good friends right here in town
I can usually find me a free beer somewhere, with offers of free meals I am
blessed...
Should I go crazy, blow all my money and ruin my life,
well at least I'll never go hungry, I guess, here in Freehold

Well, I got a good Catholic education here in Freehold
Led to an awful lot of masturbation here in Freehold
Father, it was just something I did for a smile
Hell, I still get a good one off once in a while
and dedicate it to Freehold
Don't get me wrong, I ain't puttin' nobody down
Hell, in the end it all just goes and comes around
It's one hell of a town
Freehold....

Rock,"You're makin' a fool out of yourself
By following me around
Like a Japanese woman who stands ten steps in the shadow of her man
You're following me around
You're following me around

You're makin' a joke of yourself
Your friends are talking behind your back
You're makin' a joke of yourself
Your friends are talking behind your back

What you gonna do
What you gonna do

Makin' a fool of yourself over me
Makin' a fool of yourself, can't you see
Makin' a fool of yourself over me
Over me, over me, over me
Proves that you have good taste

Makin' a fool of yourself
By slipping around
Shooting up ___(?)
Under the ground

But it just gets to prove
That you've got good taste
You've got good taste"
Rock,"I saw him by the dj
The way he danced was cool
They said I stood no chance
They called me little fool
Well here I am before you
And all your friends can see
You roasting like a turkey
It's just this flame in me

And no one can burn like me

I am a laser
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strong

I dreamed how much I'd lay on you
Sitting by your side
Driving in my Dusenburgh
Going for a ride
I'm going to turn my beam on
If only for an hour
You know I switch the heat on
When you feel my golden shower

And no one can burn like me

I am a laser
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strong

I know what the boys call me
They think I'm Black Barbarella
But only one beam do I have
And that's this heartbeat of mine

I am a laser
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strong

Rock,"Look up here, I'm in heaven
I've got scars that can't be seen
I've got drama, can't be stolen
Everybody knows me now

Look up here, man, I'm in danger
I've got nothing left to lose
I'm so high it makes my brain whirl
Dropped my cell phone down below
Ain't that just like me?

By the time I got to New York
I was living like a king
Then I used up all my money
I was looking for your ass
This way or no way
You know, I'll be free
Just like that bluebird
Now ain't that just like me?
Oh I'll be free
Just like that bluebird
Oh I'll be free
Ain't that just like me?"
Rock,"Why do we try so hard
What makes us give our all
And why do we aspire
To reach the height
When we're not ready
To take the fall

What makes us so unkind

And why must we desire
And take what we want
Why must we be the
Only ones who receive

Lord won't you take me
Take me and break me
Burn me with your fire
Our love that will take me
Take me and make me
I'll be
I will follow you

Why is it that now I'm yours
Everything seems so bright
And why is it now I can
Live for each day
Without any fear of the night

Lord since I met you
I can't get you
Out of my head
My life was so lonely
Cos I was only
Living for myself
Our love
I will follow you

I'll follow you
My days are right
I'll follow you
It seems so right
I'll follow you
Bad days are gone
I'll follow you"
Rock,"I'm staring at the setting of the sun
For I know my time with you is nearly gone
And my minutes, they're so precious, yes, each and every one
As I try to make the most of what is least.

I've a weary kind of feeling in my mind,
I'll try to look ahead and not behind.
And I know that you don't mean to be unkind
As I try to make the most of what is least.

The rain is dripping down my window pane
And if you came back to me, it wouldn't be the same.
I know the end is near and I'll try to battle on
As I try to make the most of what is least.

I'm staring at the setting of the sun
For I know my time with you is nearly gone
And my minutes, they're so precious, yes, each and every one
As I try to make the most of what is least.

Lonely nights down by the railroad track,
I see you going and never coming back.
I'll try, I'll try, I'll try to battle on

Pop,"Girl, I just can't live without you
I know I hurt you
That's the last thing I meant to do
Sometimes I can be careless and blind
Can you forgive the fool that I've been?

You know I love you
You're the one thing I have that's true
My life used to be nothing to me
I never want to feel that again

(Chorus)
If you go away girl
You're taking my heart with you
If you go away girl
You'll be breaking my heart in two
If you only stay girl
I promise you the world
So please don't ever go away

You know I need you
I'm so sorry that I made you cry
You are everything good in my life
Your tears have finally opened my eyes

If you go away girl
You're taking my heart with you
If you go away girl
You'll be breaking my heart in two
If you only stay girl
I promise you the world
So please don't ever go away

I was so wrong to ever look at another baby
Even the strongest man can stumble and fall
And I'll do anything for you
Anything to be in your arms again
Baby don't let this be the end
I was so wrong to ever look at another girl

If you go away girl
You're taking my heart with you
If you go away girl
You'll be breaking my heart in two
If you only stay girl
I promise you the world
So please don't ever go away

Girl, I just can't live without you

Never, ever leave me girl
You promised your love to me forever
Say you'll never leave me girl"

Whatá½ the fuss your makin
Caná½t you see the light?
You gotta get down when you roll upon the town
It'll makes you feel alright

I know that youá½re a liar
Eatin from your hand

Runnin helter skelter
Kockem down and belt you
Show me who is the boss
you better treat her sweet
Or you be out in the street
And that would be a loss

My life is a good life to lead
Writing on the wall is a good story to read

Lining up the tour bus
Iá½m sure they woná½t thank us
Needle in your mouth
But now that we know where to shoot the goods again

They just want you to stay the same
They want to keep you in between
So hold that pose like a figurine

Don't it make you want to scream?
Don't you get it, yet?
They think of you as a statuette

And the wrong kind of people don't want you to change
They just want you to stay the same
They're gonna ask you 'Where you been?
' Make you wait, like a mannequin
They want to keep you high and dry
To furnish them with an alibi
They want to keep you in between
So hold that pose like a figurine
Figurine
Don't it make you want to scream?
Don't you get it, yet?
They think of you as a statuette

Well the wrong kind of people don't want you to change
They want you to stay the same
They don't want you to be free
They want you to watch TV

Rock,"The animist, illusionist
I'm trying to make a deal with my dentist
Listening true lies during the day
Sketching my life in my own way
Illustrating the day
Using the best spray
The wall, the paper, the sky
The creator, the thief, the spy
Making a new contractto justify
What my eyes can see, what my mouth can spit
where's my muthafucka fee?

Cause time is running while i'm here
With my kilos on my knees
Enthusiastic innocence in a resonant day
Blowing old images from another place
Wake up!
Trough necessites of all forms of life
Wake up!
The solutions are almost alive
Illustrating the day...

Feel the aroma of the Brave New Wolrd."
Rock,"Everybody tells me, we love your songs
Your soul is precious, but it just ainâ€™t good enough
You need a single to help you through
Program directors, they all make the rules
I said, youâ€™re kidding, youâ€™re putting me on
What about the Constitution, freedom of expression
Listen to the music, just feel the sound
Love is the motion, thatâ€™s what makes the world go around


Sing, Songs of Freedom
Bring joy to the world
Sing, Songs of Freedom
Bring joy to the world


Everybody listen, stop and take some time
To understand the world situation
There is no meaning in fighting the way we do
Letâ€™s come together and forgive each other


Sing, Songs of Freedom
Bring joy to the world
Sing, Songs of Freedom"
Rock,"Gotta Get it On
Since the sun came up this morning
Seems I'm into something new
I think you're gonna get it
All my troubles are a falling
All my dreams are coming true
All my dreams are coming true
All because I think of you
All my dreams are coming true
After all time and space I've learned the taste
I've learned how to feel the meaning of my memories
Open up the space between us
You'll find that the only way
Find its the only way
Get down on your back and pray
Find it's the only way
After all I knew and yet I couldn't last
Now I've learned to feel the meaning of my past
And if youre gonna live tomorrow
You gotta get it on today
Got to get it on today
Got to get it on today

Rock,"Fiona Apple - First Taste

I lie in an early bed,
thinking late thoughts
Waiting for the black to replace my blue
I do not struggle in your web
because it was my aim to get caught
But daddy longlegs,
I feel that I'm finally growing weary
Of waiting to be consumed by you

Give me the first taste, let it begin
Heaven cannot wait forever
Darling, just start the chase -
I'll let you win but you must
Make the endeavor

Oh, your love give me a heart contusion
Adagio breezes fill my skin with sudden red
Your hungry flirt borders intrusion
I'm building memories
on things we have not said
Full is not heavy as empty,
not nearly my love,
not nearly my love,
not nearly

Give me the first taste, let it begin
Heaven cannot wait forever
Darling, just start the chase -
I'll let you win, but you must
Make the endeavor"
Pop,"I watch your troubled eyes as you rest
And I fall in love with every breath
Wonder if those eyes are really shut
And am I the one you're dreaming of?

Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this cause I noticed
A little bit shining through the seems

And if this is what it takes
Then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way
If this is what it takes

You keep on telling me I'm wasting time
But to call it wasting time, oh that's a crime
And you think it's crazy what I'm tryna to
Well baby, I'm a fool for you

Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this cause I noticed
A little bit shining through the seems

And if this is what it takes
Then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way

Cause if you don't understand yet
Then I'll never let you forget it
You don't have to do this on your own
I'll be your shoulder to lean on
I'll be your right when you feel wrong
So c'mon take my hand, we're moving on

And if this is what it takes
Then let me be the one to bear the pain
And if this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls
that supposed that are in our way
If this is what it takes"
Rock,"Though deep set and somewhat shadowed
Her life...her mystery
Well It's not so different than the way that he said
""So don't hide behind your eyes from me that way baby""
?
In his heart he wishes her stardom
His eyes want for her much more
That's not so different
Than the way that he said
""There are so very few stars left""
?
Don't hide behind your hair
It's a bit of gold and braid
Easy come the tears
You see a pathway ending with a doorway
You slip toward the doorway
Been waiting there all day
All these years
?
Don't hide it
In his heart he wishes to forget her
Like to make it better
And hold her like a child
?
Don't hide your eyes that way
Don't hide anything not anymore
Because I never did not love you
I never did run from you
In a dream I said to you
That I'd always love you"

She's open waiting for more

For attention before
She smokes a dozen and he doesn't seem to notice the smell
He took the seat off his own bike because the way that it felt
He wants bone this I know
She is ready to blow

Rock,"When I think of you Baton Rouge
I think of a Mariachi band
I think of sixteen and a crisp green football field
I think of a girl I never had

When I think of you Baton Rouge
I think of a back seat in a car
Windows are foggy and so are we
as the police asked for our I.D.

So helpless
so helpless

Ooohhh, ooohhh, so helpless
ooohhh, so helpless
Ooohhh, so helpless
so helpless

Well I once had a car lost it in a divorce
the judge was a woman of course
She said give her the car and the house and your taste
or else I set the trial date

So now when I think of you Baton Rouge
and the deep southern belles with their touch
I wonder where love ends and hate starts to blush
in the fields in the swamps in the rush

In the terra-cotta cobwebs of your mind
when did you start seeing me as a spider spinning web
Of malicious intent and you as poor, poor me
at the fire at the joint, this disinterred and broken mount
in the bedroom in the house where we were unmarried

So helpless, so helpless
so helpless
So helpless, so helpless
so helpless

When was I the villain in your heart
putting the brake on your start
you slapped my face and cried and screamed
that's what marriage came to mean
The bitterest ending of a dream

You wanted children and I did not
was that what it was all about
You might get a laugh when you hear me shout
you might get a laugh when you hear me shout
I wish I had


So helpless, so helpless
so helpless
So helpless, so helpless
so helpless

Sometimes when I think of Baton Rouge
I see us with two and a half strapping sons
One and a half flushed daughters preparing to marry
and two fat grandsons I can barely carry

Daddy, uncle, family gathered there for grace
a dog in a barbecue pit goes up in space
The dream recedes in the morning with a bad aftertaste
and I'm back in the big city worn from the race of the chase
what a waste

So thanks for the card the announcement of child
and I must say you and Sam look great
Your daughter's gleaming in that -
- white wedding dress with pride
sad to say I could never bring that to you that wide smile

So I try not to think of Baton Rouge
or of a, of a, of a Mariachi band
Or of sixteen and a crisp green football field
and the girl, and the girl I never had

So helpless, so helpless
so helpless
So helpless, so helpless
so helpless

Lovin you ain't easy cos
My pride gets in the way

Words are like butter
Rolling off my lips
Cut like a knife
And now I'm sinking battleships

You know who you are, mm-hmm

Give me a reason to take you back
Give me a reason to share
Give me a reason, cos love is in season
But give me a reason to care
I like my freedom, yeah that's my style
My manifesto lullaby
Give me a reason, cos love is in season
But give me no reason to cry

There's something in your kiss
That I can't let you go
My heart says yes
My head says no

Passion so cruel
When it's hard to resist
I'm fashionably cool
But it's you that I miss

Give me a reason to take you back
Give me a reason to try
Give me a reason, cos love is in season
But give me no reason
My passion's in season
But give me no reason to cry"
Pop,"Like a waterfall in slow motion

[CHORUS]
I'm still tryna to do it big for my whole town
When I'm back we can go all night
Let me see those mittens up, mittens up in the sky

Let em clear my throat, uh
Somebody take my coat, alright
Got the new to the game hunger
I've been running around, gunnin' 'em down, givin' 'em all a fake number
Apologies for that (I'm sorry)
I gotta keep my suitcase packed
You can add it to the arsenal
It's that Cobain, Donnie Darko flow
Hey lady, I didn't catch your name, lady
Let me do it to you good all night
Cause the nose ring might as well be a bulls-eye
Let me clear my throat

The goal was to go and get Scott Storch dough
And stay away from Scott Storch clothes
Have I done it yet? Not quite
I'm back in your city, never the same chick twice
Damn homie, in high school you was the man, homie
Damn, what the fuck happened to you?
All my plaques just sittin' in the closet
Cause I ain't have time to get 'em no spot yet
Don't I just glide on the beat
Ain't I so smooth on that motherfucka, bingo
My mixtape shit going harder than your single
Let me clear my throat

[CHORUS (x2) ]
I'm still tryna to do it big for my hometown
When I'm back we can go all night
Let me see those mittens up, mittens up in the sky

What up doe?
What up doe?"
Rock,"Talk about the heart of Christmas,
Talk about the reason and the rhyme.
Talk about the sentimental feelings,
Talk about the candlelight and wine,
Talk about the children.

Listen to the voices singing.
Listen to the laughter as they play
But listen to the whisper of a heartbeat
Whose loneliness is never far away.

(Chorus)
In some hearts it's never Christmas,
But it's winter all the time.
All our lives spent waiting for the sun,
Children of tomorrow,
How they need a star to follow.
In some hearts it's always winter,
For some hearts it seems,
That Christmas never comes.

Don't forget the winter's children,
Shadows on a star that never shines.
Looking for the love that never happened
Looking for the Chris in Christmas time.
The lonely voice,
That can't rejoice,
That has no choice.

(Chorus)
In some hearts it's never Christmas,
But it's winter all the time.
All our lives spent waiting for the sun,
Children of tomorrow,
How they need a star to follow.
In some hearts it's always winter,
For some hearts it seems,
That Christmas never comes.

(Chorus)
In some hearts it's never Christmas,
But it's winter all the time.
All our lives spent waiting for the sun,
Children of tomorrow,
How they need a star to follow.
In some hearts it's always winter,
For some hearts it seems,
That Christmas never comes."

Pop,"Last summer we met
I'll never forget
Hanging out every day
Guess that era has gone
You got what you want
Hope she works out OK

I bet you think I'm torn
That you're the one I miss
I'm over now you're gone
But that's not the way it is

Surprise
Why you call me up late at night
Expecting me to want to die
I'm busy here with some other guy
It's good since you told me goodbye
Ooh ho ho ho, Ooh ho ho ho, Ooh ho ho ho
It's good since you told me goodbye
Ooh ho ho ho, Ooh ho ho ho, Ooh ho ho ho

Don't go wasting your time
Expecting me crying
Lost like I can't go on
Yeah, my pride's still intact
No danger of that
It must hurt to know you're wrong

You think I'm on my own
Just waiting for the chance
I'm getting what I want
But it's not the way you planned

Surprise
Why you call me up late at night
Expecting me to want to die
I'm busy here with some other guy
It's good since you told me goodbye
Ooh ho ho ho, Ooh ho ho ho, Ooh ho ho ho
It's good since you told me...

Maybe you've been saying it's a tragedy
Baby if you were big enough for me (????)
Now I've got someone who's taking care of me
It's you that's crying tears
And I like the way it feels

Surprise
Why you call me up late at night
Expecting me to want to die
I'm busy here with some other guy
It's good since you told me goodbye
Ooh ho ho ho, Ooh ho ho ho, Ooh ho ho ho
It's good since you told me goodbye

I said oh pretty baby, is it something I've said?
Tell me why little baby.

And show me where to go cause I'm on to you
Me like the first time you felt loving forever

Rock,"It's very far away
It takes about a half and a day to get there

No it's not in Spain
But all the same you know, it's a groovy name
And the wind's just right.
Hey !

Hang on my darling
Hang on if you wanna go
Here it's a really groovy place
It's uh, just a little bit of uh, said uh, Spanish Castle Magic.

The clouds are really low
And they overflow with cotton candy
And battle grounds red and brown
But it's all in your mind
Don't think your time on bad things
Just float your little mind around
Look out ! Ow !

Hang on my darling, yeah
Hang on if you wanna go
Get on top, really let me groove baby with uh Just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic. Yeah baby,

Rock,"I heard you say bartender make it strong
I had to guess your lover's gone
I don't know and you don't know me
But there's no reason to be lonely alone

Is this seat taken, do you like this song?
Do you tear up when it comes on?
You know it's always the same for me
For there's no reason to be lonely alone

How 'bout a friend that looks like me?
A little gem, a little misery
We could use a little company
Maybe honey that's what we could be

You probably heard this line a thousand times
But you seem like someone I have known
Is it the mesquite or do you agree
There's no reason to be lonely alone

How 'bout a friend that looks like me?
A little gem, a little misery
We could use a little company
Maybe honey that's what we could be

You go your way and I'll go mine

There's no reason to be lonely alone"
Rock,"Where has all that Rock'n'roll gone
Oh won't somebody tell me where?
'Cos it used to be when I was young
That you could hear them playing it everywhere
But now it seems they're all so hooked on fashion
The music's taken second place
Everyone it seems has one obsession
To beat the others in the race
And it just don't feel right to me
No no it just don't feel right to me

'Cos I love that Rock'n'roll too much
And I don't wanna see it ever waving goodbye
Yeah I love that Rock'n'roll too too much
And I couldn't bear to see it go by
Rock'n'roll you're too much to deny

Oh where has all that music gone
There must be some mistake
From something that was so much fun
They were burning bridges in their wake
O.K. everything has got to keep changing
I know it has to be that way
But isn't it too high a price we're paying
We're losing most of yesterday
And it just don't feel right to me"
Rock,"Was she never there
Was she ever
Was it air she breathed
At the wrong time
Oh ho
Oh ho
Oh ho
Oh ho

All the flowers so
From the gallery
With the hymns of night
Singing come to me
At the wrong time
On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now
If I'm dreaming all my life

Just one living chance
When the mother sighs
When the father steps aside
At the wrong time
Oh ho
Oh ho

Was she never here
Was she ever
Was it air she breathed
At the wrong time
On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life

To be your own police?

I gotta' know.

Are you ready to stand up and sing,
That you're tired of the war and all that shit?
Oh, tell me, are you ready to do your bit?

You gotta' take a stand,
Give your brother a helping hand.
We got to start today,
So tomorrow our kids can play.
We better do what's right,
So we don't have to fight,
No more.


'Bout the only way I see that we can change the plan,
Is to vote and get our man.
The man whose not afraid,
And one whose not over-paid.

Rock,"Put down your things and rest awhile
You know we've both nowhere to go
Yeah, daddy had to crash
He was always halfway there you know
And no, I don't pretend there's any more of that
They say one day, you'll look up and laugh and hear

The same sad echo when you walk
Yeah, the same sad echo when you talk loud and clear
It's the same as the same sad echo around here

I promise you this winter
I will worship you like gold
And ride your train forever
Electric fortunes to be told
And I don't want to question or even celebrate
All the joy you took and then gave back too late

It's the same sad echo when you lie
It's the same sad echo when you try to be clear
It's the same as the same sad echo around here

Well, I woke up right here
In a pool of sweat
With a box of pills and you
Yeah, and I'm gonna keep my head
I'm gonna keep my cool
Oh, I'm so in love with you
Yes and in another world nothing was like this
There may have been a girl
There never was a kiss

The poison came in liquid
She was naked all the time
And no one could explain it
It was all between the lines
And I don't seem to trust anyone no more
It could be faith I'm just not sure

It's the same sad echo every day
Yeah the same sad echo another way
When you call
It's the same as the same sad echo most of all

Well you just got tired
You just gave in
You took it hard
Then you just quit
You let me down
You dropped the ball
You fell on your face most of all
And I don't want to mean anything to you
I don't want to tempt you to be true

It's the same sad echo comin' down
It's the same sad echo all around in my ears
It's the same as the same sad echo around here"
Rock,"Boy that bottle belongs to the devil
Better leave it on the shelf
Could be the old man wants it for himself
Well it hurts my heart to see a young man fall

Hurt me to my bones
To see him high in the morning
And by evenin' see him gone
Boy that woman belongs to the captain

Better let her go her way
Before the captain got somethin' to say
Well it hurts my heart to see a young man fall
Hurt me to my bones

To see him high in the morning
And by evenin' see him gone
Boy that power belongs to the devil
Better leave that power alone

Could be the devil gonna want it for his own
Well it hurts my heart to see a young man fall
Hurt me to my bones
To see him high in the morning and by evenin'

See him gone
To see him high in the morning and by evenin'
See him gone"
Pop,"Now that we've come to an end
You say that you wanna be friends.

Don't say a word, don't make a sound,
Don't keep in touch, don't come around,
Don't ask me how I'm doing now,
Don't think of me, just fade me out.
Forget about me and I'll forget about you.

I can't pretend that I don't love you anymore
I can't be friends cause it hurts like it's never hurt before.
Now you think that I'm cold and I don't care about you,
I'm better without you, couldn't be further from the truth.
Girl, I'm dying, I'm just trying to survive you.

My scars are still burning since you walked away,
Cause you rip them wide open when I see your face.
I'm back at square one trying to breathe through the pain,
You don't even know what you're doing to me.
When I get through to life after you?

I can't pretend that I don't love you anymore
I can't be friends cause it hurts like it's never hurt before.
Now you think that I'm cold and I don't care about you,
I'm better without you, couldn't be further from the truth.
Girl, I'm dying, I'm just trying to survive you.

Now that we've come to the end
You say that you wanna be friends.
But I,

I can't pretend that I don't love you anymore
I can't be friends cause it hurts like it's never hurt before.
Now you think that I'm cold and I don't care about you,
I'm better without you, couldn't be further from the truth.

I'm just trying to survive you."

Mama, where's your pretty little girl tonight
Trying to run before she can walk - that's right
She's growing up
She has a young man waiting
She's growing up
She has a young man waiting
Wide eyes
She'll be street-wise
To the lies
And the jive talk
She'll find true love
And tenderness on the block

Daddy, don't you ask her when she's coming in
And when she's home don't ask her where she's been
She's going out
She has a young man waiting
She's going out
Can't keep her young man waiting
She'll be okay
Let her have her day
It's a long way
It's a long walk
She'll find true love
And tenderness on the block

I know how much it hurts to see her go
She has a mind of her own, you know
She's all grown up
She has a young man waiting
She's all grown up
She has a young man waiting
She was wide-eyed
Now she's street-wise
To the lies
And the jive talk
She'll find true love
And tenderness on the block
She'll find true love
And tenderness on the block

Rock,"She's out of her mind
like the wind in the storm
Oh, like the ocean in the dawn
as it disappears, with the riptide

She's out of her mind
she's pulled away by the moon
She's ripped from her sleep
as the cold luna sweep gains control

Ooohhh, what you gonna do with your emotions
Ah, ones you barely recognize
In your sleep I heard your screaming, ooohhh
""This is not voluntary! This is not voluntary!
If this is life I'd rather die!""

In the riptide, in the riptide

She's out of her mind, riptide
like a muscle that swells
You know when you trip
whether you're well or sick, your body aches

She's out with the tide
gone to a prisoner's dance
Where a monkey's her date
eating limbs off a plate with a spoon

Ooohhh, what you gonna do with your emotions
said the seagull to the loon
What you gonna do with your emotions

She said ""Please wake me up""
She said ""Don't touch me now""
She said ""I wish I was dead""

With the riptide

She's out of her mind
riptide, you always win
It happens over and over again
riptide

She's out of her mind
like a hurricane's rain
She does not stand a chance
at this luna dance, riptide

I was thinking of Van Gogh's last painting
the wheatfields and the crows
Is that perhaps what you've been feeling
When you see the ground
as you fall from the shy
As the floors disappears from beneath your feet riptide

She's going out of her mind
out with the tide
out of her mind
riptide

She's going out of her mind
with the riptide
She's going out of her mind
ah, riptide

Rock,"You'll never see the courage I know
It's color's richness won't appear within your view
I'll never glow the way that you glow
Your presence dominates the judgements made on you

But as the scenery grows I see in different lights
The shades and shadows undulate in my perception
My feelings swell and stretch; I see from greater
heights
I understand what I am still too proud to
mention -- to you

You'll say you understand, but you don't understand
You'll say you'll never give up seeing eye to eye
But never is a promise, and you can't afford to lie

You'll never touch these things that I hold
The skin of my emotions lies beneath my own
You'll never feel the heat of this soul
My fever burns me deeper than I've ever shown -- to
you

You'll say don't fear your dreams, it's easier than
it seems
You'll say you'd never let me fall from hopes so
high
But never is a promise and you can't afford to lie

You'll never live this life that I live
I'll never live the life that wakes me in the night
You'll never hear the message I give
You'll say it looks as though I might give up this
fight ...

But as the scenery grows I see in different lights
The shades and shadows undulate in my perception
My feelings swell and stretch; I see from greater
heights
I realize what I am now too smart to mention -- to
you

You'll say you understand; you'll never understand
I'll say I'll never wake up knowing how or why
I don't know what to believe in; you don't know who
I am
You'll say I'll need appeasing when I start to cry

Pop,"Why did you leave me here to burn?
I'm way too young to be this hurt
I feel doomed in hotel rooms
Staring straight up at the wall
Counting wounds and I am trying to numb them all

Do you care, do you care?
Why don't you care?
I gave you all of me
My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears
Why don't you care, why don't you care?
I was there, I was there, when no one was
Now you're gone and I'm here

I have questions for you
Number one, tell me who you think you are
You got some nerve trying to tear my faith apart
(I have questions for you)
Number two, why would you try and play me for a fool?
I should have never ever ever trusted you
(I have questions)
Number three
Why weren't you, who you swore that you would be?
I have questions, I got questions haunting me
I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you

My, my name was safest in your mouth
And why'd you have to go and spit it out?
Oh, your voice, it was the most familiar sound
But it sounds so dangerous to me now

I have questions for you
Number one, tell me who you think you are
You got some nerve trying to tear my faith apart
(I have questions for you)
Number two, why would you try and play me for a fool?
I should have never ever ever trusted you
I have questions for you
I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you

Do you care, do you care?
Why don't you care?
I gave you all of me
My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears
Why don't you care, why don't you care?
I was there, I was there, when no one was
Now you're gone and I'm here

I have questions for you, ooh
I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I have questions for you, ooh
I have questions for you (fair play, no, fair play, no)
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you
I have questions for you
How do I fix it? Can we talk?
Can we communicate? Can we talk?
Do I wanna fix it?
I have questions for you (I'm afraid of you)
Is it my fault? Is it my fault? Do you miss me?
I have questions"
Rock,"Before this world starts up again
It's me and night
We wait for the sun
The kids and drunks head back inside

Well there's lots of smart ideas in books I've never read
When the girls come talk to me I wish to hell I had

(Get Up, Get Up) Turn on ignition
(Get Up, Get Up) Fire up the system
Play my little part in something big

I'll accept with poise, with grace
When they draw my name from the lottery
And they'll say 'All the salt in the world couldn't melt that ice'
I'm the one who gets away
I'm a New Jersey success-story
And they'll say 'Lord, give me a chance to shake that hand'
(They'll say)

Back when I was younger I was someone you'd've liked
Got an old guitar I'd had for years I'd let you buy
And I'll tell you something else that you ain't dying enough to know
There's still some living left when your prime comes and goes

(Get Up, Get Up) Dance on the ceiling
(Get Up, Get Up) Boy, you must be dreamin'
Rock on young saviour, don't give up your hopes

I'll accept with poise, with grace
When they draw my name from the lottery
And they'll say 'All the salt in the world couldn't melt that ice'
I'm the one who gets away
I'm a New Jersey success-story
And they'll say 'Lord, give me a chance to shake that hand'

I have one last wish
And it's from my heart
Just let me down
Just let me down
(easy)

I'll accept with poise, with grace
When they draw my name from the lottery
And they'll say 'All the salt in the world couldn't melt that ice'
I'm the one who gets away
I'm a New Jersey success-story
And they'll say 'Lord, give me a chance to shake his hand'
(They'll say)"
Pop,"I'd heard rumors and I'd heard talk
About the trail you'd left of broken hearts
About the sea of tears too wide to cross
But a little bad press has never scared me off
So I burned a path to figure out
How to get me some of what you got
I've got a red hot heart
If the talk is true your's is the same
And we should be together
And let our passions fan love's flame

When I looked for you I almost passed you by
You were so cool and calm I thought my friends had lied
But I thought so much reserve must make you wild inside
It was there and then that I knew I had to get some of what you got

I've got a red hot heart
If the talk is true your's is the same
And we should be together
And let our passions fan love's flame

I thought I'd won your heart when I held you hand in mine
I thought it was true love the way we complemented each other
But my right is your wrong
And when you're right then I'm left with nothing
Your light and your heat have all been spent
Leaving only smoke and ashes
Only smoke and ashes baby

I've got a red hot heart
Any your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins
I say there's fire down below
You say it's only smoke and ashes baby

I'm crying all the time
Salty stinging tears
And mourning for the past carbon-dated years
But knowing now for certain that you were always right
Because if a breeze could blow you out of my life
It's only smoke and ashes baby
Only smoke and ashes baby

I've got a red hot heart
And your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins
I say there's fire down below
You say it's only smoke and ashes baby

I was blinded by devotion
My unwavering love for you
So blinded that I thought all your lies were true
But now I know for certain since you've gone away
It was just a smoldering fire I mistook for a blaze
Only smoke and ashes baby

I've got a red hot heart
And your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins
I say there's fire down below
You say it's only smoke and ashes baby
Only smoke and ashes baby, baby ..."
Pop,"Just like an apple
Cut down the middle
I only have a matching half
I gave you the finger
You took me to dinner
And you made me laugh

I took one look in your eye
You know when you know it
You fit me perfectly right
You? re the other half of me

I don't need this bullshit
Only for the foolish
But you? re the other half of me
I never believed it
Was too proud to need it
You? re the other half of me
You? re the other half of me
You? re the other half of me

Better than chocolate
You? re right in the pocket
You were tailor-made for me
I wanna have your baby
Gotta have you like crazy
And iron your shirts

I took one look in your eye
You know when you know it
You fit me perfectly right
You? re the other half of me

I don't need this bullshit
Only for the foolish
But you? re the other half of me
I never believed it
Was too proud to need it
But you? re the other half of me
You? re the other half of me
You? re the other half of me
Half of me
You're the other half of me

I took one look in your eyes
You fit me perfectly right
You? re the other half of me

I don't need this bullshit
Only for the foolish
But you? re the other half of me
I never believed it
Was too proud to need it
But you? re the other half of me
You? re the other half of me
You? re the other half of me
Half of me
You? re the other half of me

I took one look in your eyes"
Rock,"I keep on dancin', dancin'.
Nothing left to say, nothing left to do.
I find myself alone, I'm thinking just of you.
You got me dancin', dancin'.
Why don't you help me? Why don't you guide me?
Why don't you promise? To stand beside me.

There was a man in a foreign land,
in love with a woman that didn't understand.
Love is not a thing you command,
love is something that keeps you and keeps you.
Dancin', dancin'.
Why don't you help me? Why don't you guide me?
Why don't you promise? To stand beside me.

I keep on dancin', dancin'.
Nothing left to say, nothing left to do.
I find myself alone, thinking just of you.
You've got me dancin', dancin'.
Why don't you help me? Why don't you guide me?
Why don't you promise? To stand beside me.

Dancin', dancin', dancin', you've got me, ohhhh, help me!
Guide me, why don't you promise, to stand beside me.
Help me, ohhhh!

"
Pop,"Verse 1
Close your eyes, baby count to three, and tell me now,
Did you think of him, like it used to be, it ain't no surprise,
Cos he's out of love, and he's out of luck, getting lazy now,
With that attitude, I've had enough, and it won't be the first time,

Bridge
Remember the lies you denied cos you said so, yeah what got into you?
Remember the love you discovered that he'd shown, Mmm what's he trying to prove?
Remember the pay every day that he let go, look what he's done to you,
And he still he wanted you to run around him girl.

Chorus
No it shouldn't be like that, not fooling me,
Damn his love and damn his lies, they're buggin' me,
No it shouldn't be like that, he's trying to be,
Trippin' out like all the guys, why can't you see?

Verse 2
It's 3am, and he still ain't home, out with his friends,
Guess you could have thought, guess you should have known, that he ain't coming
back,
Girl he's out of line, and he's out of time, cos I'm telling you,
Gotta take him on, and show your mind, and it won't be the last time.

Middle 8
So put away your money, she don't wanna know,
It's too late to say you're sorry, she don't wanna know
She's leaving don't you worry, boy let it go,
Had your chance make no advance to take it, and I told you so.

Outro
Girl I'm saying, that his love and his lies, keep you waiting
Now he's paying, cos you're no longer his for the taking
"
Pop,"I still remember when love wasn't made for fun
I chased your heart like an outlaw on the run
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
The way your hand was the perfect size for mine
We are the victims, the criminal was time
You know-oh-oh, you know-oh-oh
The stars are dying out and we're in the dark

The stars are dying out and we're in the dark
If our love started burning brighter than a lighthouse
Would you shine for me again?
Cause I would set my heart on fire
If it helps you find your way to me again

I remember when nothing was the same
Close my eyes and the colors start to fade
They start to fade, they all turn gray
I miss running my fingers through your head
When I reach out my hand, you're just not there
Cause you walked away and I wish you'd stay
The stars are dying out and we're in the dark

If our love started burning brighter than a lighthouse
Would you shine for me again?
Cause I would set my heart on fire
If it helps you find your way to me again

If our love started burning brighter than a lighthouse
Would you shine for me again?

If our love started burning brighter than a lighthouse
Would you shine for me again?
Cause I would set my heart on fire
If it helps you find your way to me again

I still remember when love wasn't made for fun
I chased your heart like an outlaw on the run
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh"
Pop,"If you knew that you would die today,
If you saw the face of God and Love,
Would you change? Would you change?

If you knew that love can break your heart,
When you're down so low you cannot fall,
Would you change? Would you change?

How bad, how good does it need to get?
How many losses, how much regret?
What chain reaction would cause an effect?
Makes you turn around, makes you try to explain,
Makes you forgive and forget, makes you change?

If you knew that you would be alone,
Knowing right, being wrong,
Would you change? Would you change?

If you knew that you would find a truth,
That brings up pain that can't be soothed,
Would you change? Would you change?

How bad, how good does it need to get?
How many losses, how much regret?
What chain reaction would cause an effect?
Makes you turn around, makes you try to explain,
Makes you forgive and forget, makes you change?
Makes you change

Are you so upright you can't be bent?
If it comes to blows are you sure you won't be crawling?
If not for the good, why risk falling?

If everything you think you know,
Makes your life unbearable,
Would you change? Would you change?

If you'd broken every rule and vow
And hard times come to bring you down,
Would you change? Would you change?

If you knew that you would die today,
If you saw the face of God and Love,
Would you change? Would you change?
Would you change? Would you change?

If you saw the face of God and Love,
If you saw the face of God and Love,
Would you change? Would you change?"

Pop,"Way it's gonna
Way it's gonna

Lately I find I'm caught up in these thoughts
How will you come to me
How will we connect these hearts
Are you somewhere near
Hidden like a four-leaf clover
Are you miles away
Are we getting any closer
Are we getting any closer

I already see us moving mountains
I already see us walking water
I already see the clouds we're flying
Over and under
I already see us having babies
Walking through the park and being lazy
I already see myself falling in love eternally
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be

I already see us moving mountains
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be
I already see us walking water
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be

Being with you
Is a like a scene from a dream in heaven
I feel you running through
All my senses
Will you taste like rain
Can I breathe you like air
Will I lose myself in your arms somewhere

I already see us moving mountains
I already see us walking water
I already see the clouds we're flying
Over and under
I can really see us having babies
Walking through the park and being lazy
I already see myself falling in love eternally
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be
I think that's just the way it's gonna be

And I know and I know and I know
Love can move a mountain
And I know and I know
It's gonna be even better than I imagined
Putting all my trust in you
Putting all my trust in you
We'll make this dream come true

I can really see us having babies
Walking through the park and being lazy
I already see myself falling in love eternally
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be

I already see us moving mountains
The way it's gonna be
I already see us walking water
The way it's gonna be
I can really see us having babies
The way it's gonna be
I already see myself falling in love
Meant to be
I already see us moving mountains
The way it's gonna be
I already see us walking water
To me
The way it's gonna be
I can really see us having babies"
Rock,"Calling over to seize my hunger
To see you to feel you
To be with need you

We hold out we hold on
I'm older colder
Here it comes light up my sky

[Chorus:]
Yeah we share the same sun
Everyday
Yeah we share the same sun
Everyday

White lights blinding
Headlights driving
To see you to feel you
To be with need you

We hold out we hold on
I'm older colder
Here it comes light up my sky

[Chorus]
When my light is out for you at home
It shines for me in early dawn
We're worlds apart but now I see
I'm in your heart whenever we are apart
And the sky shines bright

Within the morning sun (in the morning sunday morning sun)
Our time has just begun (time has just begun has just begun)
In the morning sun (in the morning sunday morning sun)
Our time to end [?] will come

When my light is out for you at home
It shines for me in early dawn
We're worlds apart but now I see
I'm in your heart whenever we are apart
And the sky shines bright

Yeah we share the same sun everyday"
Rock,"Goodnight, Marie
It's time to go to bed now
But you notice that I don't wanna go
Suddenly
I'm hearing what you said now
And I hold my breath as you close the door

When you're looking at me
The world ceases to be
I find myself not wanting to leave
And I want you so much
But we don't even touch
I remind myself, ""Remember to breathe""
I remind myself, ""Remember to breathe""

Goodbye, Marie
Goodbye to me
Now I wonder who I was before you
Pray for me
You gotta pray
And I hold my breath, don't know what to do

When you're looking at me
The world ceases to be
I find myself not wanting to leave
And I want you so much
Rut we don't even touch
I remind myself, ""Remember to breathe""
I remind myself, ""Remember to breathe""

If you don't know what you've got
You'll never get it right
I find myself not wanting to leave
If you don't know what you've got
You'll never get it right
I remind myself, ""Remember to breathe""

I remind myself, ""Remember to breathe"""
Rock,"You get up every morning at the sound of the bell
You get to work late and the boss man's giving you hell
Till you're out on a midnight run
Losing your heart to a beautiful one
And it feels right as you lock up the house
Turn out the lights and step out into the night

And the world is busting at its seams
And you're just a prisoner of your dreams
Holding on for your life `cause you work all day
To blow `em away in the night

The rat traps filled with soul crusaders
The circuits lined and jammed with chromed invaders
And she's so pretty that you're lost in the stars
As you jockey your way through the cars
And sit at the light, as it changes to green
With your faith in your machine off you scream into the night

And you're in love with all the wonder it brings
And every muscle in your body sings as the highway ignites
You work nine to five and somehow you survive till the night
Hell all day they're busting you up on the outside
But tonight you're gonna break on through to the inside
And it'll be right, it'll be right, and it'll be tonight

And you know she will be waiting there
And you'll find her somehow you swear
Somewhere tonight you run sad and free
Until all you can see is the night
"
Rock,"It sickens me to see,
Photograph in front of me, carnation coloured pink
Stand aside and take a drink,
Night club, another scene, 31st it's Halloween.,
Slave to each new trend, Uptown junkies push again,

The lovers and the wannabe's (they don't know how)
The radio's and TV's (they don't know how)
Newspaper story reads (they don't know how)
Cheap girl magazine (they don't know how)

Stand aside and cry, never wonder why,
Ask themselves why, the river has dried,

Laughter after three, shaped up to be free,
Number one the most missed chart,
Must have broke a thousand hearts,
Parallel with the scene, tarnished star evergreen,
Live life disguised.

The lovers and the wannabe's (they don't know how)
The radio's and TV's (they don't know how)
Newspaper story reads (they don't know how)
Cheap girl magazine (they don't know how)

Stand around and cry, never wonder why,
Ask themselves why, the river has dried

Pop,"Baby I just don't get it
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume, the make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are ,you stick around and I just don't know why

If I was ya man (baby you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'd be coming home (back to you)
Every night, doin' you right
You're the type of woman (deserves good thangs)
Fistful of diamonds (hand full of rings)
Baby you're a star (I just want to show you,you are)

You should let me love you
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
Baby good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby you should let me love you, love you, love you

Listen
Your true beauty's description looks so good that it hurts
You're a dime plus ninety-nine and it's a shame
Don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go they stop and stare
Cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes, Out of control, baby you know

If I was ya man (baby you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'd be coming home (back to you)
Every night doin' you right
You're the type of woman (deserves good thangs)
Fistful of diamonds (hand full of rings)
Baby you're a star (I just want to show you, you are)

You should let me love you
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
Ooh Baby good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby you should let me....

You deserve better girl (you know you deserve better)
We should be together girl (baby)
With me and you it's whatever girl, hey!
So can we make this thing ours?

You should let me love you
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
Baby good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby you should let me love you, love you, love you

Let me love you that's all you need baby"
Rock,"Shakey threw a party that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement - it was so-so

The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better - it was so-so

Yeah! it was time to unfreeze
When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees
Slam! so it wasn't a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame

Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
Well he talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
Well he walks like a jerk
But he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune

A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
So Shakey hung him up to dry
The pundits were joking the manholes were smoking
And every bottle battled with the reason why

The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played the Tiger Rag
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding

Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah! I ran to the street, looking for information

Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune

Watch that man
Watch that man
Oh ah oh
Watch that man
Oh oh oh
Watch that man
oooh ooh
Watch that man
oh (Watch that man)
(Watch that man)
(Watch that man)
(Watch that man)
(Watch that man) oh oh
(Watch that man)

Pop,"You walk into the room
So perfect but unaware
Making me stop and stare
Every time I heard he broke your heart
Can I just fix you girl?
Show you a different world?

I'll take you anywhere
I'll put you on a throne
I'll lay down my heart, I swear
And I'll make sure that you'll never be alone

Only my shadow knows
How I feel about you
Only my shadow goes
Where I dream of you and me
Should I go or wait?
Is it too soon, too late?
Only my shadow knows

I've been loving you so long
And now that I got the chance
I see you need to dance on your own
So I'll wait another day
Maybe another year
I'm gonna be right here, oh

I'll take you anywhere
I'll put you on a throne
I'll lay down my heart, I swear
And I'll make sure that you'll never be alone (alone)

Only my shadow knows
How I feel about you
Only my shadow goes
Where I dream of you and me
Should I go or wait?
Is it too soon, too late?
'Cause only my shadow knows

I wish I could say all these words
All these things that your heart never heard, yeah
But I saw the pain in your eyes and it sealed my lips

Only my shadow knows
How I feel about you
Only my shadow goes
Where I dream of you and me
Should I go or wait?
Is it too soon, too late?
Only my shadow knows, ey
Only my shadow knows, oh oh

Only my shadow knows"

Speak in extreme
It'll save you time
You were a saint abroa
But a devil at home
Come on here, woo-woo
And kiss it for me

Kiss it for me, woo-woo
Kiss it for me
Woo-woo, kiss it for me
Come on here, woo-woo
Kiss it for me
Kiss it where it counts

Come on here, woo-woo
Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo
Kiss it for me

Rock,"Hey I am not in your way
Hey no need to push me again
I know it's your day in the sun
Last time I checked he came to light the lamp for everyone

""Relax love"" he said before he left
""Take those hands away from your eyes
From where I stand you're in my sky""

You must go must flee
For they will hunt you down
You and your unborn seed
In all of Gaul is there safety?

Les Saint Marie de la Mer
You will dance the ring
Marys of the Sea
The lost bride weeps
Les Saint Marie de la Mer
We will dance your ring

Hey there's a new Jerusalem
Hey you built on rock that's on sand
For now you have hijacked the son
Last time I checked he came to light the lamp for everyone

I hear a voice and it says
""The red of the red rose is its own
And something no man can divide""
So St. Jermaine hear the prayer of this supplicant
For two scarlet women, Black Madonna
Hey I am not in your way
Hey no need to push me again
I know it's your day in the sun
I know it's your day in the sun
Hey I am not in your way
Hey no need to push me again
I know it's your day in the sun
Last time I checked he came to light the lamp for everyone"

Shiruetto ya kage ga kakumei o miteiru

Silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
It's no game

I am bored from the event
I really don't understand the situation
And it's no game

Documentaries on refugees
Couples 'gainst the target
You throw a rock against the road
And it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday, and it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain, and it makes all the papers

To be insulted by these fascists - it's so degrading
And it's no game

Up The Hill Backwards

The vacuum created by the arrival of freedom
And the possibilities it seems to offer
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it

A series of shocks - sneakers fall aart
Earth keeps on rolling - witnesses falling
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it

Yeah, yeah, yeah - up the hill backwards
It'll be alright ooo-ooo

While we sleep they go to work
We're legally crippled it's the death of love
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it

More idols thean realities
I'm OK, you're so-so

Yeah, yeah, yeah - up the hill backwards

Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)

She had an horror of rooms she was tired you can't hide beat
When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home
She could've been a killer if she didn't walk the way she do, and she do
She opened strange doors that we'd never close again

She began to wail jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean

Chorus: (twice)
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

She asked me to stay and I stole her room
She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street and she can't socialise
Well I love the little girl and I'll love her till the day she dies

She wails
Jimmy's guitar sound jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean

(Chorus) (twice)

(Chorus) (twice)

Oh oh woh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh

Ashes To Ashes

Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song
I've heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh no, don't say it's true

They got a message from the Action Man
""I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed to love
Sordid details following""

The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I
Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet it's glowing

Chorus:
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
""I'm happy, hope you're happy too""
One flash of light but no smoking pistol

I never done good things
I never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now

(Chorus)

Repeat
My mother said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom

Fashion

There's a brand new dance but I don't know its name
That people from bad homes do again and again
It's big and it's bland full of tension and fear
They do it over there but we don't do it here

Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Turn to the right
Oooh, fashion!
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep

There's a brand new talk, but it's not very clear
Oh bop
That people from good homes are talking this year
Oh bop, fashion
It's loud and tasteless and I've heard it before
Oh bop
You shout it while you're dancing on the ole dance floor
Oh bop, fashion

Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Right
Fashion!
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep

Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no

Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do

Teenage Wildlife

Well, how come you only want tomorrow
With its promise of something hard to do
A real life adventure worth more than pieces of gold
Blue skies above and sun on your arms strength in your stride
And hope in those squeaky clean eyes
You'll get chilly receptions everywhere you go
Blinded with desire - guess the season is on

So you train by shadow boxing, search for the truth
But it's all, but it's all used up
Break open your million dollar weapon
And push your luck, still you push, still you push your luck
A broken nosed mogul are you
One of the new wave boys

Same old thing in brand new drag
Comes sweeping into view, oh-ooh
As ugly as a teenage millionaire
Pretending it's a whizz kid world
You'll take me aside, and say
""Well, David, what shall I do?
They wait for me in the hallway""
I'll say ""Don't ask me, I don't know any hallways""
But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner
I feel like a group of one, no-no
They can't do this to me
I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife

Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes
The word is that the hunted one is out there on his own
You're alone for maybe the last time
And you breathe for a long time
Then you howl like a wolf in a trap
And you daren't look behind

You fall to the ground like a leaf from the tree
And look up one time at that vast blue sky
Scream out aloud as they shoot you down
No no, I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife
I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife

And no one will have seen and no one will confess
The fingerprints will prove that you coudn't pass the test
There'll be others on the line filing past, who'll whisper low
I miss you he really had to go
Well each to his own, he was
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-ohh
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-ohh
Another piece of teenage wild...
Wild
Wild
Wild

Scream Like A Baby

Well I wouldn't buy no merchandise
And I wouldn't go to war
And I mixed with other colours
But the nurse doesn't care
And I hide under blankets
Or did I run away
I really can't remember
Last time I saw the light of day

But I remember Sam 'cause he was like me

Chorus:
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun

Well they came down hard on the faggots
And they came down hard on the street
They came down harder on Sam
And they all knew he was beat
He was thrown into the wagon
Blindfolded, chains, and they stomped on us
And took away our clothes and things
And pumped us full of strange drugs
And oh I saw Sam falling
Spitting in their eyes
But now I lay me down to sleep
And now I close my eyes
Now I'm learning to be a part of soc-society

(Chorus)

No athletic program, no discipline, no book
He just sat in the backseat swearing he'd seek revenge
But he jumped into the furnace
Singing old songs we loved

(Chorus) (twice)

Kingdom Come

Well I walked in the pouring rain
And I heard a voice that cries ""It's all in vain""
The voice of doom was shining in my room
I just need one day somewhere far away
Lord I just need one day

Well I'll be breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes I'll be breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay

Well the river's so muddy, but it may come clear
And I know too well what's keeping me here
I'm just the slave of a burning ray
Oh give me the night, I can't take another sight
Please, please give me the night

Chorus

Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high
Up in the tower they're watching me hoping I'm gonna die

I won't be breaking no rocks
I said ""I won't be breaking no rocks""

(I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh
(I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
When the kingdom comes (repeat ad inf)

Because You're Young

Psychodelicate girl - come out to play
Little metal faced-boy - don't stay away
They're so war-torn and resigned she can't talk any more
What are they trying to prove?
What would they like to find?

It's love back to front and no sides - like I say
These pieces are broken - like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know

Chorus:
Because you're young - you'll meet a stranger some night
Because you're young - what could be nicer for you and it makes me sad
So I'll dance my life away
A million dreams, a million scars

He punishes hard - was loving her such a crime
She took back everything she said
Left him nearly out of his mind
They're people I know - people I love
They seem so unhappy - dead or alive

It's love back to front and no sides - like I say
These pieces are broken - like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know

(Chorus)

A million dreams
A million scars
A million (repeat ad inf.)

It's No Game (Part 2)

Silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
Just walkie-talkie - heaven or hearth
Just big heads and drums - full speed and pagan
And it's no game

I am barred from the event
I really don't understand the situation
So where's the moral
People have their fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists it's so degrading
And it's no game

Documentaries on refugees, couples 'gainst the target
Throw a rock against the road, and it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday, and it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain, and it makes all the papers

And it's no game

Children round the world, put camel shit on the walls
They're making carpets on treadmills, or garbage sorting

And it's no game"
Pop,"I saw you told the world
You're a single girl
I won't lie that broke my heart
Thought we were the same
But now I can't explain
How we got so far apart

Poison words from all your friends
I deserve the thing they've said
Still ain't worse than what I'm saying in my own head

So tell me I'm a waste of love
Tell me that I'm not enough
Say you hope I see the truth
That I won't find no one like you
Tell me you don't care no more
When you know I can't let go
Beat my heart all black and blue
'Cause it ain't half as bad as what I put you through
What I put you through

Every single day
I asked you to stay
When I should've let you go
Couldn't settled down
But needed you around
Different worlds, I wanted both

Girl, I know that it weren't fair
You can shame my every step
Still ain't worse than what I'm saying in my own head

So tell me I'm a waste of love
Tell me that I'm not enough
Say you hope I see the truth
That I won't find no one like you
Tell me you don't care no more
When you know I can't let go
Beat my heart all black and blue
'Cause it ain't half as bad as what I put you through
What I put you through
What I put you through
Put you through

I know you won't forgive me
And you probably don't believe me
But this isn't easy, no, this isn't easy
I swear it's like I'm breathing
Like a part of me is leaving
And I can't forgive me, I hope you believe me

So tell me I'm a waste of love
Tell me that I'm not enough
Say you hope I see the truth
That I won't find no one like you
Tell me you don't care no more
When you know I can't let go
Beat my heart all black and blue
'Cause it ain't half as bad as what I put you through
What I put you through
Oh-woah, woah I put you through, yeah
What I put you through"
Rock,"I've spent my last night
strung up and pulled tight, holding out
sleeping proud
an answer comes without a ""please""
do what you want

wonder why I'm so caught off guard when we kiss
I'd rather live my life in regret than do this
what happened to the love we both knew?
we both chased?
hanging on a cigarette
you need me
you burn me
you'll burn me

hushed with a finger
don't say you'll never when you might...
just another time
this poison comes instruction free
do what you want but I'm drinking

try to lie better next time
stay on my side tonight"
Rock,"“The Winged Painter is on uptown” I said

You know

Fa' sure (So So Def)
It's the 2k top dawg
Don't nobody want it
I got 10K on it, I'm the hottest thing out
If you look at me, you're lookin' at a kid with a plan
If you don't understand homie, check soundscan
So So Def to grain
You know our motto
In the street throwin' paper like we just won the lotto
Guest on the beat, like dubs hit on the six
Irresistible to all chicks
Listen to the remix

[Jessica (JD)]
Don't you try to tell me that he's not my type
To hide what I feel inside
When he makes me weak with desire
I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase
But I can't stop fanning the fire
I know I'm meant to say no
(Uh, uh, handclap, oh)

[Jessica]
But he's irresistible
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe
More than just physical
Deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me

Oh I can hardly breathe, yeah
Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right
That I should really say goodnight
But I just can't stop myself
Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same
That I don't want to play no game
Cause when I feel his arms hooked around me
I know I'm meant to say no (I'm meant to say no)
(Clap your hands)

[Jessica]
But he's irresistible
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe
More than just physical
Deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me

Can't you see
Whenever he's close to me
I really find it hard to breathe
He's so irresistible
Think you know
Deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
He's so irresistable
(You're so irresistable)

But he's irresistible
Up close and personal
Now inescapable

Rock,"In the beginning, She was stunning and pure,
When he first saw her, he fainted to the floor.
She was distant and arrogant from the start,
She did not see the fragile state of his heart.
She fell in love with him on that very day,
She became softer in every way.

Chorus:
Even though they were so in love,
They drew a line in the sand just because.
They did not know each other, they did not trust.
The only thing that they did together was to make love.

So paradise found was like paradise to him.
Oh yes he loved her but he was still an Englishman.
Tropical birds and the heat and the ocean,
Oh it drove her crazy drove her away from him.

Chorus

She burned his house down saying you may have forgotten me,
But you'll remember this, you fell to the ground when you saw this.
My face, my eyes, my lips
You may have forgotten me, but you'll never forget that kiss.

Chorus

The big house burned down all around her,
In the smoke and the fire.
In the devastation they never found her.
She went back into her red dress back to her white house to her ocean.
And after that no words were spoken about the two of them ever again.

Chorus

In the beginning she was stunning and pure.
In the smoke and the fire they never found her.
She went back into her ocean, back to her white house.
For a while they were so in love.
For a while they were so in love.
She burned his house down.
My face, my eyes, my lips.
You may have forgotten them
You may have forgotten them
You may have forgotten them
But you'll never forget that kiss."
Rock,"The cat sleeps in the red chair
My lover combs her jet black hair
There's mystery in a way of walking
It's witching hour no need to talk

And there are diamonds in our bed
I put your hands about my head
My lover worships the sun
Her body is the Amazon

My lover is of royal birth
My lover smells of the good earth

I give my love my life to wear
I taste my life in that black hair
At three o'clock it's time to say
Rest you love till break of day
Rest you love till break of day

Though I won't phone nor will I write
I wish you happiness tonight
I thank you for this witching hour
I give you love, I give you power

I run my fingers through your soul
I know my love you make me whole
Forgive me if I say too much

Well, the heart she gave me

Think I'll wait till sunset,
See the ensign down.
Think I'll wait till sunset,

Would be the boss of me

We fly through the night

Life has your mind and soul
It spins on your hips

Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed

Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed
That a small town girl like you
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me

You look at me and you reach for the free blue sky
I look to the stars as they flicker and float in your eyes
And under these wings of steel the small town dies

Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed

Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed
That a small town girl like you

Pop,"I'm messing with the same girl
But she wasn't my baby


It's crazy, let me tell you about my baby
She's so amazing, yeah, I met her out in La
You wouldn't know what the fuss is all about
I just hope that she ain't creeping around


She's coming over tonight, so you can see for your own eyes
I think I finally found the one for me, yeah, I'm not gonna lie


There's something about the way you're talking about her, reminds me of my baby
But I don't know why she would want to share her heart, I don't know
Cause all of this time I thought that she was mine, but now you're telling me
That it's the same girl, we're with the same girl


You said you met her on the west side, but she ain't even from there
She loves them Miami nights, you should see her when she's down here
Now I can't be the only one that's showing love to her
But I didn't know that she was showing it too


She never told you
You were supposed to know


There's something about the way you're talking about her, reminds me of my baby
But I don't know why she would want to share her heart, I don't know
Cause all of this time I thought that she was mine, but now you're telling me
That it's the same girl, we're with the same girl


So you was trying to see what's up, you were feeling the vibe
Little thing on the east coast, 305
It's obvious she probably in a jam most of the time
Cute face, little waist, and she just your type, right?
Ain't that crazy how it goes?
Thought she was the one, but she really one of those
But don't trip, man, it's a big world
And I know what I'd say if I find a little girl
I'd be like, ""Yo sabes que you te quiero""
If you coming with me, you know I'm taking care of you
I'mma pull out a ring and say ""I wanna marry you""
But you know I ain't sharing you, nope


There's something about the way you're talking about her, reminds me of my baby
But I don't know why she would want to share her heart, I don't know
Cause all of this time I thought that she was mine, but now you're telling me
That it's the same girl, we're with the same girl


There's something about the way you're talking about her, reminds me of my baby

Rock,"She was born in the end of 1900
Bambina ritorna alla casa
Papa'd say eat soja-beans
And put in your hard-time jeans
He'd shoot me up to go to school
Then give me pills to keep me cool.

Bambina ritorna alla casa
I was eight, I felt out of shape
I guess I needed something to get straight
The casual-capsule was the only scape.
Though papa thought it was disgusting to take.

Bambina ritorna alla casa
Dad got shocked, red and green
""What the neighbors think seeing you clean""
I ran away on a foggy day,
Met E.T., feeling just like me.

Bambina, ritorna alla casa.
He took me up to the martian meadows
Where now my nu-nuclear plant grows
Happy with my Hologram-home,
My youngest baby-clone,
papa talks on the T.V. Phone

Bambina ritorna alla casa
Bambina guarda la macchina

Rock,"(Ronnie Lane)

So good to be with
the people that know you.
It's good to hear
the things that they say,
At times when you are with them.
So good to note
my strength is growing from day to day,
There's not a thing
I try to do without you

Troubled times of pain that come
I take them any old day.
You come and you wash them all away

Everywhere you sing in everything,
and I try by remembering
all the things that you said to me,
from within all you did for me.
"
Pop,"I don't mind spending some time
Just hanging here with you
Cuz I don't find too many guys
That treat me like you do
Those other guys all wanna take me for a ride
But when I walk their talk is suicide
Some people never get beyond their stupid pride
But you can see the real me inside
And I'm satisfied, oh no, ohh

Even though the gods are crazy
Even though the stars are blind
If you show me real love baby
I'll show you mine

I can make you nice and naughty
Be the devil and angel too
Got a heart and soul and body
Let's see what this love can do
Baby i'm perfect for you

My love, ohh oh

I could be your confidante
Just one of your girlfriends
But I know that love's what you want
If tomorrow the world ends
Why shouldn't we be with the one we really love?
Now tell me who have you been dreaming of
At night at home? oh no, ohh

Even though the gods are crazy
Even though the stars are blind
If you show me real love baby
I'll show you mine

I can make you nice and naughty
Be the devil and angel too
Got a heart and soul and body
Let's see what this love can do
Baby i'm perfect for you

Excuse me for feeling
This moment is critical
Might be me feeling
It could get physical, oh no, no no

Even though the gods are crazy
Even though the stars are blind
If you show me real love baby
I'll show you mine

I can make you nice and naughty
Be the devil and angel too
Got a heart and soul and body
Let's see what this love can do
Let's see what this love can do
Baby I'm perfect for you

Baby I'm perfect for you

Even though the gods are crazy

Even though the stars are blind

Even though the gods are crazy

Even though the stars are blind"
Rock,"Idolise tabloid lives
From God to art
We need a star
You're in my soul
You're in my mind
I walk on water every night

Moviestar, don't know where you are
Moviestar, don't know who you are

I love your taste
I love your shape
I love the things about you all the critics hate
You fill my soul, I once was blind
You turn my water into wine

Moviestar, don't know where you are
Moviestar, don't know who you are

You don't know what it's like needing you
You don't know what it's like needing you
You don't know what it's like needing you
Oh you're such a star

You get me high
You blow my mind
You make my mundane life all worthwhile
Give me reason
Give me rhyme
Do anything for you, just give me a sign

Moviestar, don't know where you are
Moviestar, don't know who you are
Moviestar, don't know where you are
Moviestar, don't know who you are

Rock,"There I was, back in the wild again
And I felt right at home where I belong
I had that feelin' comin' over me again
Just like it happened so many times before

The spirit of the woods is like an old good friend
It makes me feel warm and good inside
I knew his name and it was good to see him again
'Cuz in the wind he's still alive

Oh, Fred Bear, walk with me down the trails again
Take me back, back where I belong
Oh, Fred Bear, I'm glad to have you at my side, my friend
And I'll join you in the big hunt before too long
Before too long

It was kinda dark, another misty dusk
And it came from a tangle down below
I tried to remember everything he taught me so well
I had to decide which way to go

Was I alone or in a hunter's dream?
'Cuz the moment of truth was here and now
I felt his touch, I felt his guiding hand
The buck was mine, forevermore

Because of Fred Bear
I'll walk down these trails again
Take me back where I belong
Oh, Fred Bear, I'm glad to have you at my side my friend
And I'll join you in the big hunt before too long
We're not alone when we're in the great outdoors
We got his spirit, we've got his soul
He will guide our steps, he'll guide our arrows home
The restless spirit forever roams

Fred Bear, walk with me down the trails again
Take me back, back where I belong
Oh, Fred Bear, I'm glad to have you at my side, my friend
And I'll join you on the big hunt before too long

Oh, Fred Bear, walk with me down the trails again
Take me back, back where I belong
Oh, Fred Bear, I'm glad to have you at my side, my friend
And I'll join you in the big hunt before too long

In the wind he's still alive
In the wind he's still alive
In the wind he's still alive
In the wind he's still alive
In the wind, I hear, I hear Fred Bear

(I hear ya Fred,
Talk to me,
yea ,
its all right
lets go hunting baby
Say Fred, you go up on that ridge
And I'll go down in the swamp
We'll get that buck)

(Fred)
(If some of our teenage thrill seeker really want to go out and get a thrill.
Let them go up into the north west and let them tangle with a Grizzly bear
or Polar bear or brown bear and get that effect that will cleanse the soul.)"
Pop,"Don't you know
They're talkin' about a revolution
It sounds like a whisper
Don't you know
They're talkin' about a revolution
It sounds like a whisper

While they're standing in the welfare lines
Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation
Wasting time in the unemployment lines
Sitting around waiting for a promotion

Don't you know
They're talkin' about a revolution
It sounds like a whisper
Poor people gonna rise up
And get their share
Poor people gonna rise up
And take what's theirs

Don't you know
You better run, run, run...
Oh I said you better
Run, run, run...
'Cause finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' bout a revolution

Yes finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin'about revolution"
Pop,"[Verse 1:]
You might be expecting
To hear me saying things
Pertaining to love
Me emotionally, I've been through so many other things,
But I'm not wasting
My time or energy
On another sad love song, babe I love you, please don't go,
Not even worth talkin bout it.

[Chorus 1:]
Don't wanna talk about how,
He broke my heart.
Don't wanna talk about how,
We fell apart.
So many other things I've,
Experienced.
Don't wanna make this a love song.

Don't wanna get into what,
Made us so happy.
All the moments we kissed,
Boy you really had me.
Maybe this could exist,
In new situations
Don't wanna make this a love song.

[Verse 2:]
I'm not neglecting,
All those feelings,
I have in me,
But I just don't feel the need,
To express them so openly.
That's just not me,
Because when I speak,
I want the things,
That are coming from me,
To be something I'm proud to speak.
(yae-yae-yea yea)

[Pre-Chorus:]
Cause everything that I'm hearing on the radio,
Is only talking bout love,
How they can't let it go.
Why is it that everybody, takes the lonely road,
Is there nowhere else to go.

[Chorus 2:]
Don't wanna talk about how,
He broke my heart.
Don't wanna talk about how,
We fell apart.
So many other things I've,
Experienced.
Don't wanna make this a love song.

Don't wanna get into what,
Made us so happy.
All the moments we kissed,
Boy you really had me.
Maybe this could exist,
In new situations
Don't wanna make this a love song.

[Bridge:]
How can it be,
That nobody seems to care (when nobody seems to care),
The love songs are everywhere (The love songs are everywhere)
(That I hear)

[Chorus 3:]
Don't wanna talk about how,
He broke my heart. (Yae-Yeah)
Don't wanna talk about how,
We fell apart. (Fell Apart, whoa, whoa)
So many other things I've,
Experienced.
Don't wanna make this a love song.

Don't wanna get into what,
Made us so happy. (No, No, No)
All the moments we kissed,
Boy you really had me. (You really had me)
Maybe this could exist,
In new situations (I, don't wanna talk about another sad love song)
Don't wanna make this a love song."

Fight, i could fight with the best

That i couldn't find what i used to in your eyes
Isn't it time, yeah

Forget your worries
We're here to enjoy this party
We'll rock tonight

Shut up and follow me
Look this and say me what you see
Come dance, come sing

Reloading, energizing
Creating guts, freeing up
Not giving a fuck, cheering up

Rock,"Ten years ago on a cold dark night,
There was someone killed 'neath the town hall light.
There were few at the scene but they all did agree
That the man who ran looked a lot like me.

The judge said, ""Son what is your alibi ?
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die.""
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life,
I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife.

She walks these hills in a long black veil.
She visits my grave where the night winds wail.
Nobody knows, no, and nobody sees,
Nobody knows but me.

The scaffold is high and eternity nears
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear.
But sometimes at night where the cold winds moan
In a long black veil she cries all o'er my bones.

She walks these hills in a long black veil.
She visits my grave when the night winds wail.
Nobody knows, no, and nobody sees,
Nobody knows but me.

"
Pop,"If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore

There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
To keep you by my side
And keep you from walkin' out the door

Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
And there'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same
If you walk away, everyday it will rain
Rain, rain-a-a-ain

I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Oooh if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Sayin' there goes my little girl
Walkin' with that troublesome guy

But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Oooh, but little darlin' watch me change their minds
Yea for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'till I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right

Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
And there'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same
If you walk away, everyday it will rain
Rain, rain-a-a-ain

Don't you say (don't you say)
Goodbye (goodbye)
Don't you say (don't you say)
Goodbye (goodbye)
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right

Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
And there'll be no clear skies

Rock,"I wish I was smarter
I got so lost on the shore
I wish I was taller
Things really matter to me

But I put my face in tomorrow
I believe we're not alone
I believe in Beatles
I believe my little soul has grown

And I'm still
So afraid
Yes, I'm still
So afraid
Yeah, I'm still
So afraid
On my own
On my own

What made my life so wonderful?
What made me feel so bad?
I used to wake up the ocean
I used to walk on clouds

If I put faith in medication
If I can smile a crooked smile
If I can talk on television
If I can walk an empty mile

Then I won't
Feel afraid
No, I won't
Feel afraid
I won't be
Be afraid
Anymore

Anymore
And then I just won't be afraid
Anymore

Rock,"I wrote the words of freedom,
I've even sung the song.
But freedom is for children,
'Cause they don't understand what's wrong.


The children are so very lucky,
'Cause they're not old enough to know.
Not old enough to realize,
But they'll find out as they grow.


The children are so very lucky,
But, on the other hand, who's gonna' save the land?
The children are so very lucky,
But man's invention is gonna' be the prevention of their life.


This song is nearly over,
And so's the world and the day.
There's something missin',
But who will listen enough to do what it will take?


Freedom is for children. Why can't it be for me?
Freedom is for children. Why can't it be for me?


Freedom is for children. Why can't it be for me?
Freedom is for children. Why can't it be for me?
Freedom is for children. Why can't it be for me?


"
Rock,"Now lets hear the story of Bo Diddley
And the Rock n Roll scene in general
Bo Diddley was born Ellis McDaniels
In a place called McCoom, Missississipi about 1926
He moved to Chicago about 1938
Where his name was eventually changed to Bo Diddley
He practiced the guitar everyday and sometimes into the night
Till his papa's hair began to turn white
His Pa said ""Son, listen hear, I know
You can stay but that guitar has just gotta go""
So he pulled his hat down over his eyes
Headed out for them Western Skies
I think Bob Dylan said that
He hit New York City
He began to play at the Apollo in Harlem
Good scene there everybody raving
One day, one night, came a Cadillac with four head lights
Came a man with a big, long, fat, cigar said,
""C'mere son, I'm gonna make you a star""
Bo Diddley said, ""Uh..whats in it for me?""
Man said, ""Shut your mouth son,
play the guitar and you just wait and see""
Well, that boy made it, he made it real big
And so did the rest of the rock n roll scene along with him
And a white guy named Johnny Otis took Bo Diddleys rhythm
He changed it into hand-jive and it went like this
In a little old country town one day
A little old country band began to play
Add two guirtars and a beat up saxophone
When the drummer said, boy, those cats begin to roam
Oh baby oh we oh oh
Ooh la la that rock and roll
Ya hear me oh we oh oh
Ooh la la that rock and roll
Then in the U.S. music scene there was big changes made
Due to circumstances beyond our control such as payola
The rock n roll scene died after two years of solid rock
And you got discs like, ah...
Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue and so forth
About, ah, one year later in a place called Liverpool in England
Four young lads with mop haircuts began to sing stuff like, ah...
It's been a hard days night and I've been working like a dog and so on
In a place called Richmond in Surrey, whay down in the deep south
They got guys with long hair down their back singing
I wanna be your lover baby I wanna be your man yeah and all that jazz
Now we've doing this number, Bo Diddley, for quite some time now
Bo Diddley visited this country last year
We were playing at the Club A Gogo in Newcastle, our home town
The doors opened one night and to our surprise
W alked in the man himself, Bo Diddley
Along with him was Jerome Green, his maraca man,
And the Duchess, his gorgeous sister
And a we were doing this number
Along with them came the Rolling Stones, the Mersey Beats,
They're all standing around diggin' it
And I overheard Bo Diddley talkin'
He turned around to Jermone Green
And he said, ""Hey, Jerome? What do you think these guys
Doin' our..our material?""
Jerome said, ""Uh, where's the bar, man? Please show me to the bar...""
He turned around the Duchess
And he said, ""Hey Duchess...what do you think of these young guys
Doin' our material?""
She said, ""I don't know. I only came across here
To see the changin' of the guards and all that jazz.""
Well, Bo Diddley looked up and said to me,
With half closed eyes and a smile,
He said ""Man,"" took off his glasses,
He said, ""Man, that sure is the biggest load of rubbish
I ever heard in my life...""
Hey Bo Diddley
Oh Bo Diddley
Yeah Bo Diddley
Oh Bo Diddley
Yeah Bo Diddley

Rock,"Well the moon is on the highway, darkness fills the sky.
As long as I keep driving, I know that I won't die.

And I'm gone, gone, gone.
Gone Ridin'.

Well I broke up with my baby, told myself I won't cry.
Broke up with my baby, told myself a lie.

And I'm gone, gone, gone.
Gone Ridin'.
Get gone Cal.

Well the moon is on the highway, darkness fills the sky.
As long as I keep driving, I know that I won't die.

Rock,"I feel I'm taking up all of your time
And i still can't work it out, wheter or not you mind
Say you still need my love and I will be strong
Just say that you're O.K. and I'll carry on
Say you don't mind

Well I need to show my love of that I am sure
Just let me feel you close, closer than before
I'm feeling better now, now that you're near
Just let me say the things, the things you want to hear
Say you don't mind

'Cos I'm waking up - been shaken up
And I'm thrilled that I know you
I need to love - can't give enough
And all because you do - everything right to me can't you see
Say you don't mind"
Rock,"So, we'll go no more a roving
So late into the night
Though the heart be still as loving
And the moon be still as bright

For the sword outwears its sheath
And the soul wears out the breast
And the heart must pause to breathe
And love itself have rest

Though the night was made for loving
And the day returns too soon
We will go no more a roving
By the light of the moon"
Pop,"We've been together for a long time, baby

Rock,"My life was coloured, painting pictures out of tune
You came from nowhere in a song
It might have been the way I laughed, he made the jokes
Could only show me what was wrong

He took me flying on his crimson ship
He never left me his number
He took me flying on his crimson ship
Then he was gone and I wondered

Who put the knots on all the crosses on the hill?
Why did the old man wash his hands?
Who grew the flower that was big enough to kill?
And blew the trumpet in the van, a-an

He took me flying on his crimson ship
He never left me his number
He took me flying on his crimson ship
Then he was gone and I wondered
Oh-oh, oh-oh

When they were busy throwing kisses at the moon
A father lost his mother's son
And though they knew the resurrection would be soon
The time was spent, they carried on, o-on

He took me flying on his crimson ship
He never left me his number
He took me flying on his crimson ship
Then he was gone and I wondered

Wondered Wondered Wondered . . ."
Pop,"Now excuse if I sound rude
But I love the way that you move
And I see me all over you now
Baby when I look in your eyes
There's no way that I can disguise
All these crazy thoughts in my mind now
There's just something about you
You got the lock
I got the key
You know the rest
You know just where I wanna be
Don't ever stop controlling me
I kinda like it when you bring me to my knees

You got me wrapped up around your finger
I'd do anything for your love now
And when you touch it, the feeling lingers
Takes me up so I high I can't come down
You got me wrapped up baby

I don't ever wanna give up
All this spell you got me under
I see fireworks when we touch now
There's just something about you
Your body fits on mine like a glove
Let them say whatever they want
It's too late cause you're in my blood now
There's just something about you
You got the lock
I got the key
You know the rest
You know just where I wanna be
Don't ever stop controlling me
I kinda like it when you bring me to my knees

You got me wrapped up around your finger
I'd do anything for your love now
And when you touch it, the feeling lingers
Takes me up so I high I can't come down
Girl, You got me wrapped up
You got me so, so wrapped up
There's just something about you
You wrapped up
You got me so, so wrapped up
There's just something about you

[Travie McCoy]
My princess so intelligent
Make me wanna reapply to school for the hell of it
I'll be the student, you be the teacher
Ms. Sophisticated, such a pleasure to meet ya
Yeah, but here's the only issue since we met
You kinda turned my world upside down
And I don't really mind spiderman kissing you
As long as you're planning on sticking around
The happiest boy in the world award goes to me
Not a chance nobody came close to 'em
I kinda knew you was troublesome
You got me wrapped around your finger like bubblegum

Everything that you do
Every way that you move
There's just something about you
There's just something about you
Everything that you do
Every way that you move
There's just something about you

Girl you got me wrapped up around your finger
I'd do anything for your love now
And when you touch it, the feeling lingers
Takes me up so I high I can't come down

You got me so, so wrapped up
There's just something about you
You wrapped up
You got me so, so wrapped up
There's just something about you"
Pop,"I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Now I'm in a whole new world with you

Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

A whole new world
Don't you dare close your eyes
A hundred thousand things to see
Hold your breath - it gets better
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

A whole new world
Every turn a surprise
With new horizons to pursue
Every moment red-letter
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

A whole new world
That's where we'll be
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place
For you and me"
Rock,"With her killer graces and her secret places
That no boy can fill with her hands on her hips
Oh and that smile on her lips
Because she knows that it kills me
With her soft french cream
Standing in that doorway like a dream
I wish she'd just leave me alone
Because french cream won't soften them boots
And french kisses will not break that heart of stone
With her long hair falling
And her eyes that shine like a midnight sun
Oh-o she's the one, she's the one

That Thunder in your heart
At night when you're kneeling in the dark
It says you're never gonna leave her
But there's this angel in her eyes
That tells such desperate lies
And all you want to do is believe her
And tonight you'll try just one more time
To leave it all behind and to break on through
Oh she can take you, but if she wants to break you
She's gonna find out that ain't so easy to do
And no matter where you sleep tonight or how far you run
Oh-o she's the one, she's the one

Oh-o and just one kiss
She'd fill them long summer nights
With her tenderness that secret pact you made
Back when her love could save you from the bitterness
Oh she's the one, oh she's the one
Oh she's the one, oh she's the one
Oh she's the one, oh she's the one

Rock,"People from bad homes
Don't have the time
To look things over
Make up their minds

People from good homes
Dn't have the minds
To care for bad homes
Don't have the time

Home is the main line
Can't take the plain
Those people have notions
Play out this game

Stand on your own line
Stand high above
These people of caution
Trouble to love

Me I got no home
Just main street and wine
No one to hussle no one to jive
Me and my prospects just having a ball
Having the best time but nothing at all

Home is the main line
Can't take the plain

I've been

Pop,"Play the lotto you might win it
It's like 25 to life, so you bust out of prison

Something's in the air
Something's in the air

It's like that feeling when you're just about to kill it
Take your last shot
You know you're gonna hit it

Something's in the air
Something's in the air

Something big, I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones

Like oh, oh oh oh oh
Something big, I feel it happening
Oh, oh oh oh oh
Something big

It's like that feeling
When you're 'bout to win the medal
And you work so hard
That you knew you wouldn't settle

Hands are in the air
Hands are in the air

When they hear you
When you thought they wouldn't listen
It's like an anthem that the whole world's singing

Hands are in the air
Hands are in the air

Something big, I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones

Like oh, oh oh oh oh
Something big, I feel it happening
Oh, oh oh oh oh
Something big

If we stomp ou feet, the ground will shake
If we clap our hands, the walls will break
Yell so loud, won't forget our names
'Cause something big is happening

Take this rock and start a fire
Raise this up, we're feeling high
They can't tell us anything
'Cause something big is happening

Something big, I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones

Like oh, oh oh oh oh
Something big is happening
Oh, oh oh oh oh
Something big, I feel it happening, oh"
Rock,"Here we go.
(My only cold I fought.)
Here I am, frozen in time I find a way from you, pave the way.
And cause I can't stand still they'll leave you down and out.
And when your face gets here I'll stab you in the back.
Tell me now, I need to know how long.
Clear the way.
Don't make me wait all day.
With you, from you, pave my way.
And cause I can't stand still, they'll leave you down and out.
And when your face gets here I'll stab you in the back.
It's a long way home.
Can't you find your way?

Lift me up over farenheit.

Rock,"So I just walk out in the rain so that the clouds could hide the pain
And maybe you will never see the 1000 tears you gave to me
And if the rain should go away then in my lonely room I'll stay
So that the world will never know how much it hurts to see you go away

So I just live a life of hope pretending that I could not care
But if you find you cannot cope just call my name and I'll be there
If I could live my life again I still relive those precious times
Although I know there will be pain it felt so good while you were mine

Be mine be mine

So I Just walk out in the rain so that the clouds could hide the pain
And maybe you will never see the 1000 tears you gave to me
And if the rain should go away then in my lonely room I stay
So that the world will never know how much it hurts to see you go

And if you ever change your mind
I'm sure baby you will find all my sorrow and my pain
You'll find me walking in the rain"

Why are you doing this to me
Its so clear I can hear
And I'm not going to share you with no one
Surprise I've got eyes, now goodbye
How long have you had this plan
Guess it shows how much you care
Now I understand, how I just played the fool
Sure I'm going to let you go
I was wrong to ever trust you
Don't think that you'll ever know
How you could be so cruel
Its so clear I can hear

Rock,"Where the road is dark, and the seed is sowed
Where the gun is cocked, and the bullet's cold
Where the miles are marked in the blood and gold
I'll meet you further on up the road

Got on my dead man's suit and my smilin' skull ring
My lucky graveyard boots and song to sing
I got a song to sing to keep me out of the cold
And I'll meet you further on up the road

Further on up the road
Further on up the road
Where the way is dark and the night is cold
One sunny morning we'll rise I know
And I'll meet you further on up the road

Now I been out in the desert, just doin' my time
Searching through the dust, looking for a sign
If there's a light up ahead, well brother I don't know
But I got this fever burning in my soul
So let's take the good times as they go
And I'll meet you further on up the road

Further on up the road
Further on up the road
Further on up the road
Further on up the road

One sunny morning we'll rise, I know
And I'll meet you further on up the road
One sunny morning we'll rise, I know
And I'll meet you further on up the road

Rock,"The day fell down, the air got cold
I walked out in the street
Daydreamed for a mile or two
Staring at my feet like a working boy
Out of luck, falling through the cracks
Night rolled in, I turned back home
A hard wind at my back

I'm out in the cold, body and soul
There's nowhere to go
I'm out in the cold

When I woke up my brain was stunned
I could not come around
I reached out to grab my keys
And tumbled to the ground
I thought of you starry-eyed, I wonder where we stand?
Did I just fall from your arms
Down into your hands?

I'm out in the cold, body and soul
There's nowhere to go
I'm out in the cold

I'm out standing in a doorway
I'm out walking 'round hands in my pockets
I'm out in the cold"
Rock,"Oh baby don't it feel like heaven right now
Don't it feel like something from a dream
Yeah I've never known nothing quite like this
Don't it feel like tonight might never be again
We know better than to try and pretend
Baby no one coulda ever told me 'bout this
I said yeah yeah

Chorus
The waiting is the hardest part
Every day you see one more card
You take it on faith, you take it to the heart
The waiting is the hardest part

Well yeah I might have chased a couple women around
All it ever got me was down
Then there were those that made me feel good
But never as good as I'm feeling right now
Baby you're the only one that's ever known how
To make me wanna live like I wanna live now
I said yeah yeah

Chorus
The waiting is the hardest part
Every day you get one more yard
You take it on faith, you take it to the heart
The waiting is the hardest part

Oh don't let it kill you baby, don't let it get to you
Don't let it kill you baby, don't let it get to you
I'll be your bleedin' heart, I'll be your cryin' fool
Don't let this go too far
Don't let it get to you

Rock,"I wish I had a place to stay in L.A. for a week or so.
I feel like bein' jive, hangin' out, maybe go to Mexico.

Just wanna' sit in a tree, sail out to sea, live like some fantasy, ahh baby.


'Cause I'm tired of thinkin', and too much drinkin', all my troubles away.
Tired of goin' to get layed at the lost and found.
Tired of dealin' with love hurt feelings, and all I got to say,
In view of all that's been goin' down,
I think I'll go on out and pass it around.


I wonder why I'm doin', what I've been doin' for a while.
Can't say it's the money, no, so maybe it's the style.
'Cause dreamin', baby, that's the way that I like it.
Just wanna' get on a plane, go some place insane, throw myself one real good fit.


'Cause I'm tired of thinkin', and too much drinkin', all my troubles away.
Tired of goin' to get layed at the lost and found.
Tired of dealin' with love hurt feelings, and all I got to say,
In view of all that's been goin' down,
I think I'll go on out and pass it around.


I think I'll go on out and pass it around.
Listen to me baby.
Pass it around.
I think I'll go on out and pass it around.
I want to pass it around.
I want to get on out and pass it around.
I want to pass it around.


'Cause I'm tired of thinkin', and too much drinkin', all my troubles away.

Are you leaving me one more time?

thought of you as my peak
A thought of you as everything
I've had, but couldn't keep
I've had, but couldn't keep

Skip a life completely
stuff it in a cup
They said, Money is like us in time
it lies, but can't stand up
Down for you is up

It was good what we did yesterday
and I'd do it once again
The fact that you are married
only proves you're my best friend
But it's truly, truly a sin

If I could make the world as pure
and strange as what I see
I'd put you in a mirror
I'd put in front of me
I'd put in front of me

Let him think I like the chase
But I can't stop fanning the fire

Rock,"Verse 1
Going back to the memories
Reminiscing 'bout you and me
Thinking how it used to be
It's plain and clear I treated you bad
But girl you know that I care
Every relation have wear and tear.
Just draw near girl and try to hear and listen what my heart says.

Many days and many nights
Many heartbreaks... many fights
Many wrongs but so many rights
So girl don't let this love die
Never meant to 'cause you no pain,
Girl I never meant to treat you lame.
Gimme one more chance rewind come back again.
Don't let this love die.

(Chorus)
Just Cry Baby Cry
(Don't cry no more)
Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines...

Verse 2
Can you feel me reaching out to you girl,
Can you hear my open thoughts
Never want to disrespect you girl
Don’t let this come break us apart.
'Cause I know I would die without you,
My girl can you hear my broken heart.
It's calling out to the good times
That we had back at the start.

Baby...
(Don't call me baby…)
You know I need you in my life daily.
(You know you played me...)
I was a player but now your love changed me.
(Dead wrong...)
I'm going crazy
(I'm gone)....
Never thought losing you would be so hard

It's your turn to cry baby cry
(Don't cry no more)
Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines...

So let go
And move on
What we were
Is now undone
My tears have all dried
It's your turn now to cry...

Bridge
You're losing your love and your trust for me girl
And you know, I would go to the ends of the world.
If you wanted
Just like we started.
Girl ‘cause I don’t want to fight no more.
Make it like it was before.
I'd tell you the truth
And you'd cry and I'd cry
Let's get back to the place
And that look in your eyes
Can you fell it inside
No doubts in your sky
The sun is gonna shine

It’s your turn to cry baby cry

Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines"

How many people can tell you my name ?

Rock,"He only thought he was going for the thrill of a ride
Wasn't in the plan to be gone for long
But he keeps looking back over his shoulder
He knows that something might go wrong
The ride it ain't smooth that is for sure
Strange mood what is the cure
He's got that feeling of impending doom
Like being trapped in a casket inside a tomb

Death defied by will
Like a drug that doesn't kill
Boy you gotta learn what's true
Death defied by will
Like a drug that doesn't kill
The joke is on you
You ought to know better
You ought to know better

He is determined to outsmart this snake
With conviction he will stand his ground
Feeling invincible like death itself
His immortality won't be found
What should he say at his own wake
That he refuses to fulfil his fate
He doesn't know that this is his last drive
On the road we call alive

Death defied by will
Like a drug that doesn't kill
Boy you gotta learn what's true
Death defied by will
Like a drug that doesn't kill
Now the joke is on you

Now the time has come
You can't play around
And you ought to know
You ought to know better
You ought to know better

Death defied by will
Like a drug that doesn't kill
Boy you gotta learn what's true
Death defied by will
Like a drug that doesn't kill
Now the joke is on you

Pop,"You know
That I love you
In every way
You bring
So many magical wonders
To my day

How could I ever leave
One reason why
Cause darlin' without you
I cannot breathe
You're the best thing
In all my life
The only one
Who helps me through
So much pain and strife

Baby you know...
Chorus:
You'll always be in my heart
We'll never have reasons
To ever part
When I look into yor eyes
All I see is you and I
Together, forever in your heart

Darlin' yes
I love you more than words can say

You'll always be mine
No matter where you are
You're always at the front
Of my mind
Only for eternity
You've touched my heart
With undying hope
With your love
My problems can cope
No one will ever take your place
When I close my eyes
I see me
Kissing your sweet face

You're much more beautiful
Than Heaven's glowing embrace
Chorus

You'll alwyas be
Forever with me
Baby, just wait and see
You're my dream come true
And all I can say
Is that I love you

All I can say
Is I love you
Every night and day
My dreams come true
Only when I'm with you
Holding you near

I'll always be
With you, you'll see
Forever, Forever in your heart
Only always

And you're leaving me
I'll see you in the next life
I'll set you free
To find your promised land
If you're leaving me
It's really sad

Because our love is lying on a fallow field
It's the seed that you sowed
And scattered with the fallen shields

If you've got dreams you keep
Because you're leaving me
I'll see you in the next life
Don't follow me
To the poison tree
That grew up next to me
It's really sad
It's really sad

Because our love is lying on a fallow field
It's the seed that you sowed
And scattered with the fallen shields
On a last crusade to save me from myself"

she says that she can't do it anymore
She walks down St. Marks Place

she can't get off of the floor
Sally can't dance no more
they found her in the trunk of a Ford
ooohhh, she can't dance no more

Sally is loosing her face
she lives on St. Marks Place
In a rent-controlled apartment, eighty dollars a month
she has lots of fun, she has lots of fun, but

Sally can't dance no more, ooohhh
Sally can't dance no more
She took too much meth and can't get off the floor
now Sally, she can't dance no more

She was the first girl in the neighborhood
to wear tied-dyed pants, ah, like she should
She was the first girl that I ever seen
that had flowers painted on her jeans
She was the first girl in her neighborhood
who got raped on Tompkins Square, real good
Now she wears a sword, like Napoleon
and she kills the boys and acts like a son

Sally can't dance no more, ooohhh, now
Sally can't dance no more
She can't get herself off the floor, ah, huh
Sally, ooohhh, she can't dance no more

Watch this, now

Sally became a big model
she moved up to eighties and park
She had a studio apartment
and that's where she used to ball, folk singers
and that's where she used to ball, folk singers, but

Sally, she can't dance no more
Sally, she can't dance no more
Sally can't get herself off of the floor
now, Sally, she can't dance no more
(Sally can't dance)

She knew all the really right people
she went to Le Jardin
She danced with Picasso's illegitimate mistress
and wore Kenneth Lane jewels, really it's trash, but

Sally can't dance no more, ooohhh
Sally can't dance no more
She can't get herself off of the floor
now, Sally, ooohhh, she can't dance no more, no more
Dance, no more can't ...

You knew me as fire
You have always been

How I wish you could stay and a race just came in my heart we'll always---we made the best of

Our friendship wil never end 'cause your my best friend

All of the fun things we did together, I knew that we'd be friends forever (ever)
But then you had to leave, tell me how could this be my friends leave me?

They say a true friendship never ends (never ends)

But now you've sucked
your lemon peel dry, so why not get high, high, high and

Oh, I'm still missing my other half
oh, it must be something I did in the past
Don't it just make you wanna laugh
it's a lonely Saturday night

Oh, nobody calls me on the telephone
I put another record on my stereo
But I'm still singing a song of you
it's a lonely Saturday night

Now, if I was an actor
or a dancer who is glamorous
then, you know, amorous life would soon be mine
But now the tinsel light of star break
is all that's left to applaud my heart break
and eleven o'clock I watch the network news

Oh, woh, woh, something tells me that you're really gone
you said we could be friends
but that's not what's not what I want
Ah, anyway, my TV-dinner's almost done
it's a lonely Saturday night
I mean to tell you, it's a lonely Saturday night
One more word, it's a lonely Saturday night

Everything you conceal
Let me see
How it feels
Like a waterfall
You know you can have it all
Take my hand

Help me help you
Help me help you
Help me help you
Help me when you're blue

Make another plan
Feel a different sun
Set another sea
And make it start again
Take another look
Play a different game
Fly a different flag
And throw the past away

Help me heal
The way you feel
Everthing you conceal
Let me see
How it feels
Like a waterfall
You know you can have it all
Take my hand

Help me help you
Help me help you
Help me when you're blue

Help me help you

You will be free someday
The pain will go away
Just leave it in the past
You're already on your way
You know you can have it all
Take my hand

Help you (When you wanna be turned around)
Help me (When you wanna talk some more)
Help you
Help me (When you wanna be turned around)
Help you (When you wanna be turned around)

Rock,"And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I
And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I

As a child I dreamed of her, on the far banks of the river
I knew she could not be reached, for my mind was forever wondering
Far above his head, as he tried his best to teach me
The river was muddy and black, black as the coal she carried
Impossible to cross, many men had tried
The old sailor told me, another life is lost

And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I
And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I

Black was the colour of my childish dreams, impressions that would last
Black coal, coal black pit yacka's face, escaping the coal dust blast
Blind pony stumblin' to the light of day, to retire in the green fields forever
And I'll build me a bridge of steel, to beat the black river forever
I'll beat that black river forever, I'll beat that muddy river forever

And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I
And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I

Losing grip in the quicksand

Sink deeper, suffocate
A nightmare future that you never will escape

And put her little boy aboard a Greyhound Bus
Leaving Louisiana for the Golden West
Down came the tears from her happiness
Her own little son name 'o Johnny B. Goode
Was gonna make some motion pictures out in Hollywood

Bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye bye Johnny
Good bye Johnny B. Goode

She remembered taking money out from gathering crop
And buying Johnny's guitar at a broker shop
As long as he would play it by the railroad side
And wouldn't get in trouble he was satisfied
But never thought that there would come a day like this
When she would have to give her son a goodbye kiss

Going
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye bye Johnny
Good bye Johnny B. Goode

She finally got the letter she was dreaming of
Johnny wrote and told her he had fell in love
As soon as he was married he would bring her back
And build a mansion for 'em by the railroad track
So every time they heard the locomotive roar
They'd be a' standin', a' wavin' by the kitchen door

Howling

Demanding Billy Dolls

Incestuous and vain, and many other last names

Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams, I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed. Your park was real greenless
Perhaps you're smiling now, smiling through this darkness

Back in high school
He could throw that speedball by you
Make you look like a fool boy
Saw him the other night at this roadside
Bar i was walking in
And he was walking out
We went back inside, sat down, had a few drinks
But all he kept talking about was

Glory days well they´ll pass you by
Glory days in the wink of a young girl´s eye
Glory days, glory days

There's a girl that lives up the block back
In school
She could turn all the boys´heads
Sometimes on a friday i´ll stop by and have
A few drinks
After she put her kids to bed
Her and her husband bobby well they split up
I guess it´s two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times
She says when she feels like crying
She starts laughing thinking about.

Glory days...

Think i´m going down to the well tonight
And I'm going to drink till i get my fill
And I hope when i get old
I don't sit around thinking about it
But i probably will


Yeah just sitting back trying to recapture
A little of the glory of,
But time slips away and leaves you
With nothing mister but boring stories of

Glory days..."

Remembering him sing
About those heavenly mansions

Digging up the King
Begging him to sing
About those heavenly mansions

He went walking on the water
He went walking on the water
He went walking on the water
With his pills

Digging up the King
Begging him to sing
About those heavenly mansions
Jesus mentioned
"
Rock,"Life is just a bowl of All-Bran
You wake up every morning and it's there
So live as only you can
It's all about enjoy it 'cos ever since you saw it
There aint no one can take it away.

So life is just a bowl of All-Bran - very true!
What you say has made it very clear
To be sure I'll live as best as I can
But how can I remember to keep it all together
When half the moon is taken away?

Well, I've got the very thing
If you can laugh and sing
Give me those happy days toytown newspaper smiles
Clap twice, lean back, twist for a while
When you're untogether and feeling out of tune
Sing this special song with me, don't worry 'bout the moon
Looks after itself

Steve: Can I have a go?
Ron: Yes
Steve: Yeah?
Ron: Sing now:

Give me those happy days toytown newspaper smile
Clap twice, lean back, twist for a while
Well now you've got the hang of it
There's nothing you can't do with it
If you're very tuned to it you can't go wrong.

All together!

Give me those happy days toytown newspaper smile
Clap twice, lean back, twist for a while
Well now we've got the hang of it
There's nothing we can't do with it
And now we're very into it we can't go wrong!

[Stanley Unwin's nonsense here]

Give me those happy days toytown newspaper smile
Clap twice, lean back, twist for a while
Well now we've got the hang of it
There's nothing we can't do with it
And now we're very into it we can't go wrong!"
Pop,"The world is smiling
It's a little brighter
There's less politics
A little more laughter
Wars become silent
Everything's different
Nothing is hurting
And it's all working
Look at the courage
That's emanating
Saving the hearts
That were breaking
Oh yeah, it's coming
To those who are waiting
You know that it's true

It's all for you
The sun and the clouds and the blue
It's all for you
It's coming in bloom for you

Birds are singing
Quiet celebration
Right through the universe
And all across the nation
Tied hearts hoping
Building what was broken
A strength in the community
A reason to believe
Look at the message
It's high and low
If you don't listen
You'll never know
Let go of your chains
Oh, come out of your cage
The road it's all leading to

It's all for you
The sun and the clouds and the blue
It's all for you
It's coming in bloom for you

Everyone around you
Everyone that's missing
'Til the light can find you
No one's gonna know
Everyone around you
Everyone that needs you
No, don't leave us waiting
Everyone should know

Everyone around you
Everyone that's missing
'Til the light can find you
No one's gonna know
Everyone around you
Everyone that needs you
No, don't leave us waiting
Everyone should know

It's all for you
It's all for you
It's all for you
It's waiting here for you
It's all for you
It's all for you
It's all for you
It's waiting here for you
High in the clouds above
You know, you know
It's here for you
Waiting here for you"

Rock,"Oh Jesse, you better start thinkin' about saving your neck
Oh Jesse, you put on that leather jacket like you put on respect
you got cleats on your boots and a woman who shoots everytime you shuffle out the stage door
And darling Jesse, do you know what its all for?
Ah Jesse, your manager brought by them eight by ten glossies of your band
Oh Jesse, he says you wear cross around your neck and come on with nails in your hands
With your insides showing and your New York band blowin' them old Chicago blues
Ah Jesse, can't you see you're the one Jesse
Ah Sonny, this time its you
Well Jesse, your child is slobbering all over your pants
And Jesse, your wife has fallen into a trance
She's got eyes that tell no lies
She's seen so many wars
Ah be a good boy Jesse, tell her she don't have to look no more.
Well Jesse, he knows all the tricks to get the crowd reeling
Oh and Jesse, ya he rocks 'em with that old soul feeling
And he walks off the stage in a self-adoring haze
and gets shoved right out the door
Whoa Jesse, can't you see now boy that that's what its all about Jesse
Not even time to do that old played out encore
Whoa Jesse
"
Rock,"Alas my love you do me wrong
To cast me off discourteously
For I have loved you so long
Delighting in your company.

Greensleeves was all my joy,
Greensleeves was my delight.
Greensleeves was my heart of gold
And who but my Lady Greensleeves ?

Alas my love that you should own
A heart of wanton vanity
So I must laddie think alone
Upon your insincerity."
Rock,"Here we go now

I like the way you french inhale
Do it again

I like the way you french inhale

Uh, you don't gotta sell it, cuz it's already sold
And you don't gotta roll one, cuz it's already rolled
Check out my technique, just weed let it fold
Shit, I've been smokin' since I was 14 years old
I had a dime who never smoked blunts just bowls
Taught me how to blow os, inhale threw my nose
So if you see me smoking don't blow my high
Uh, so I roll one and we both gonna fly
You smell it all in my clothes
I'm taking in all the smoke when I

French inhale
I like the way you french inhale
Do it again

I take it to the face, inhale it threw my nose
Blowin' with the homies on the low, man fuck these hoes!
It crack-a-lack, pull it back
Whatcha call that mackel cracka, bad bitch like that,
a cracker jack
I'm like a florist, touring like a tourist
Godzilla flying on a pegasaurus
Niggas know about it
Even ?for I pull it out
I put some fire on it
And now they're beggin' me to put it out
I'm in the hallway rolling on the purple syke
I know the ins and outs so I'ma do what the fuck I like

Rock,"Gonna go down fightin'
Gonna go down fightin'
'Cause I know that I'm right and
I'm gonna go down fightin' for your love

Well I know what your thinkin'
You got me up against the wall
But the higher that your flyin'
The further down you gotta fall

Now don't you be fooled by my shakin' knees
'Cause I can fight dirty and when I'm scared
I get mean

Well I know you're thinkin'
That the odds is on your side
But the first thing you gotta learn is
That it just don't come down to size

I can see the seeds of doubt
Begin to grow on your face
If you wanna back down now
You know that's no disgrace"
Rock,"He said ""let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowd""
I thought ""heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever

But this is gonna take me down""
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe

Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams
Wildest dreams, oh

I said, ""no one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair
His clothes are in my room

And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good, now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request, it is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe

Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams
Wildest dreams, oh

You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Some day, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Some day, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe

Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe

Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams
Wildest dreams, oh

Even if it's just in your wildest dreams
In your wildest dreams, oh"
Pop,"He said ""let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought nothing can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down

He was sort of punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
You found me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean, and love hurts
And I still remember that day we met in december

Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your, wildest dreams, ahh
Wildest dreams, ahh

He said no one else knows me like you
And I can't help but fall, theres nothing I can do
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever, but this is getting good now

But he headed out on sunday
Said he'd come on monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipating and facing
But he was chasing paper
Caught up in the game it was the last I heard

Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your, wildest dreams, ahh
Wildest dreams, ahh

See me in hindsight
Thinking about you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around

See me in hindsight
Thinking about you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around

(Follow you around)

Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your, wildest dreams, ahh
Wildest dreams, ahh

(I will love you til the end of time
Probably a million years
Promise you'll remember that your mine
Baby can you see throught the tears
That I love you more than ever before
Say you'll remember baby
Say you'll remember baby
I will love you til the end of time)"
Pop,"I know what you're hidin' from me
You know what I'm hidin' from you
I know that you hurt me real bad
You know that I hurt you bad too

Let's just get naked
Just for a laugh
Let's just get naked
It's a trip and a half

Here comes that story again
All about that television show
Here comes my typical response
Won't you tell me something I don't know
And I'm pissed off about bein' on cops
And you're pissed off about bein' a maid
And how long till they shut off the phone
Till the next time we get laid

Let's just get naked
Just for a laugh
Let's just get naked
It's a trip and a half...
A trip and a half

We've been together so long
I hope it wasn't just the drugs
What happened to the energy we had
The morning glories and the rodeo hugs
And I know you like the back of my hand
With a stamp that says I paid to get in
And yes I am your television show
And you're the nicest place I've ever been

Let's just get naked
Just for a laugh
Let's just get naked
It wouldn't be so bad...
Let's just get naked
Just for a laugh
Let's just get naked
It's a trip and a half...

Rock,"Light of Life


All the people I knew
seem to have become one, and that one is you
In your hands I find myself
growing to be near my eternal goal
You are the sun, air and soil, helping grow


Life has found a way, at last
showing me the true light, and that light is you
In your hands I find myself glowing and embracing my eternal goal
"
Rock,"If you'll take me back
Back to your place
I’ll try not to bother you, i promise
Cause it’s cold in here
And i wish it was not
The sinks broke, it’s leaking from the faucet
And i’m fractured
From the fall
And i wanna go home
It takes two when it used to take one
It takes two when it used to take only one

Well, my money’s no good
What i’m up to—no good
No good ever comes from a promise
I’ve got a really good heart
I just can’t catch a break
If i could, i would treat you
Like you wanted me to, honest
But i’m fractured
From the fall
Ooh, and i wanna go home
I’m fractured, from the fall
And i wanna go home
It takes two when it used to take one
It takes two when it used to take one
It takes two when it used to take only one"
Rock,"I went down to Houston
And I stopped in San 'Antone
I passed up the station for the bus
I was trying to find me something
But I wasnâ€™t sure just what
Man I ended up with pockets full of dust

So I went on to Cleveland and I ended up insane
I bought a borrowed suit and learned to dance
I was spending money like the way it likes to rain
Man I ended up with pockets full of cane

Oh my sweet Carolina
What compels me to go?
Oh my sweet disposition
May you one day carry me home

I ainâ€™t never been to Vegas, but I gambled up my life
Building newsprint boats I race to sewer mains
Was trying to find me something but I wasnâ€™t sure just what
Funny how they say that â€œsome things never changeâ€

Oh my sweet Carolina
What compels me to go?
Oh my sweet disposition
May you one day carry me home

Up here in the city feels like things are closing in
The sunsetâ€™s just my light bulb burning out
I miss KENTUCKY and I miss my family
All the sweetest winds they blow across the south

Oh my sweet Carolina
What compels me to go?
Oh my sweet disposition
May you one day carry me home
May you one day carry me home
"
Rock,"Me and my baby we're just going round,
Not getting on luv,not puting it down,
We had the kind of sweet affair,
We both felt we needed.

No psychic fusion,just a steady date,
No grand illusions of the romantic fates,
She looked for her,I looked for me,
Don't know why we conceded.

CHORUS:
'Cos we were high,now we're low,
Tell me why did we go,
Falling in luv,
Falling in luv.

Under pressure from family and friends,
They seem to treasure a storybook end,
One look at them I realise luv is real overated.

CHORUS Repeated."
Rock,"One of these days my old friend
You and I won't worry no more
One of these nights it'll all wash away
And we'll wake up singing a brand-new song
We'll wake up singing a whole new song

One of these nights my little love
One of our ships will come in
One of these nights we'll fall asleep
Then wake up singing a brand-new song
We'll wake up singing a brand-new song

So much confusion has entered my life
So much confusion has torn me apart
So much confusion has made me afraid

And I don't know how to love
And I don't know who to trust
And I don't know what I did

So much confusion has enterеd my life
So much confusion goes 'round in my brain
So much confusion has torn me apart

And I don't know how to lovе
And I don't know who to trust
And I don't know why that is

One of these days my old friend
You and I will walk through that door
One of these days we'll drive away
Drive away singing a brand-new song
We'll wake up singing a brand-new song"
Rock,"When you close your eyes
Is it her you're thinking of?
Is she on your mind?
When the sleep you need won't come

When you close your eyes
Wandering the streets in pain

You dream in the summer rain
In the summer rain
You hold her once again

When you fall asleep
Is she waiting there for you?
When you close your eyes
And you lose your vital signs

Is it her that's on your mind?
Wandering the streets in pain

You dream in the summer rain
In the summer rain
In the summer rain
The summer rain

She's so far away
Her hands slipping away

The summer rain
In the summer rain
You hold her once again
You hold her once again
In the summer rain"
Rock,"I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say
That's what people say
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say
That's what people say
But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind, saying it's gonna be alright

Cause the players gonna play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate
Baby I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake
Shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, baby
Baby I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, Shake it off

I never miss a beat
I'm lighting up my feet
And that's what they don't see
That's what they don't see
I'm dancing on my own
I'll make the moves up as I go
And that's what they don't know
That's what they don't know
But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music
In my mind, saying it's gonna be alright

Cause the players gonna play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate
Baby I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake
Shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, baby
Baby I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, Shake it off

Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you been getting down
And out about the liars
And the dirty dirty cheats of the world
You could have been getting down to this sick beat

My ex man brought his new girlfriend
She's like oh my god
I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over baby we could shake, shake

Cause the players gonna play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate
Baby I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake
Shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, baby
Baby I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, Shake it off
Shake it off
Shake it off
Shake it off
Shake it off"
Pop,"Every night I say a little prayer
I lie in bed beside you and I thank go that you're there
Remembering how lonely life can be
Till heaven smiled and sent you down to me

I was born the moment that we met
It's been years and still the magic hasn't left me yet
Day by day the thrill goes on and on
The sparkle in your eyes has never gone

Chorus
Love keeps getting stronger every day
And it grows more beautiful in each and every way
And I swear I love you more
Than I did the day before
Love keeps getting stronger every day
And the things I'm feeling are impossible to say
Honey you'll just have to take my word
For all the lovely things you've never heard

Music

Love keeps getting stronger every day
All I really wanna do is spend my whole life loving you
Darling please believe me when I say
Love keeps getting stronger
Yeah it keeps on getting stronger
Love keeps getting stronger
Yeah it keeps on gettting stronger
Love keeps getting stronger
Every daaaaaay

Rock,"Pearls and swine bereft of me
Long and weary my road has been
I was lost in the cities, alone in the hills
No sorrow or pity for leaving, I feel

I am not your rolling wheels, I am the highway
I am not your carpet ride, I am the sky

Friends and liars don't wait for me
'cause I'll get on all by myself
I put millions of miles under my heels
And still too close to you I feel

I am not your rolling wheels, I am the highway
I am not your carpet ride, I am the sky
I am not your blowing wind, I am the lightning
I am not your autumn moon
I am the night, night

I am not your rolling wheels, I am the highwa
I am not your blowing wind, I am the lightning
I am not your autumn moon
I am night, night, night
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I am not your carpet ride, I am the sky"
Rock,"Never been no fragile flower
I always got too much to say
Never had much luck with love and romance
I guess it's always been that way
But I've been seriously thinking
About slippin' on the velvet gloves
I know it's strange but my lucks about to change
Cause what we got here is True love, yeh, yeh
True Love, you can't buy it - no, no
You know it ain't like nothin' else
True Love, you really ought to try it
You owe it to yourself to get ya some - True Love

You know I wake up every morning
It's the first thing on my mind
This is a permanent condition, of the most serious kind
Now let me tell you baby
That you were sent from up above
Give me a sign - let's not waste any more time
Cause what we got here is True love, yeh, yeh

I called the man at the video store and I said
Cancel my membership, I won't be needing it no more
Found something else to occupy my nights
And baby it's just the right
Amount of True Love

I called the man at the video store and I said
Cancel my membership, I won't be needing it no more
Found something else to occupy my nights
And baby it's just the right
Amount of True Love, True Love - Yeh

Everybody wants it, everybody needs True Love
Don't get me wrong about the bad love
I gotta have good love
True Love - yeah - true Love - Ohh
Ummm...
True Love

From the album ""True Love""
"
Rock,"Well, far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashin'
As majestic bells of boats struck shadows in the sun;
Sayin', it may be the chimes of freedom flashin'

Flashin' for the warriors whose strength is not to fight;
Flashin' for the refugees on their unarmed road of flight.
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night
We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'

Well, in the city's melted furnace unexpectedly we watched
With faces hidden here while the walls were tightenin'
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowing rain;
Dissolved into the wild bales of lightnin'

Yeah, tollin' for the rebel, yeah, tollin' for the raked
Tollin' for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked.
Yeah, tollin' for the outcasts burnin' constantly at stakes
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'

Oh yeah! (instrumental solo)

And then through a cloud-like curtain in a far off corner flashed
There's a hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly liftin'
Well, electric light still struck like arrows
Fired but for the ones condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin'

Well, tollin' for the searching ones on this speechless, secret trail
For the lonesome haunted lovers with too personal a tale.
And for each young heart for each channeled soul misplaced inside a jail
Yeah, we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'

Well, starry eyed and laughin' i recall when we were caught,
Trapped by an old track of vows for the hands suspended
As we listened one last time, and we watched with one last look
Spellbound and swallowed ""has the tollin' ended?""

Yeah, tollin' for the achin' ones whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless, confused, accused, misused strung out ones at worst.
And for every hung out person in the whole wide universe
We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'

Uh uh uh... (to end)"
Pop,"It's a calm wind blowing on my skin
And I've been dreaming again
Now that we're all here
We can share these notes and all this madness
We can talk of innocence
And of all the things we believe in

Is it an alibi
Is it the reason why
Is it the way we really feel inside
Set it free


The magic of those nights brings me closer to that light
That helps me see the path ahead of me
I can feel that something
A hint of mystery
A trace of dare
To live the truth I hide somewhere


Daybreak
In a place I've known before
Will I find me behind that final door


I can hear the footsteps of the past
I can feel the thunder and it's coming fast
I'm gonna spend some time with the moon
Pour myself a glass of midnight
Keep myself in tune


Is it an alibi
Is it the tears I cry
Is it the way I see it through your eyes


The magic of those nights brings me closer to that light
That helps me see the path ahead of me
I can feel that something
A hint of mystery
A trace of dare
To live the truth I hide somewhere

"
Pop,"Backstroke lover always hidin' 'neath the covers
""Gonna talk to you"" my daddy say
Said ""you ain't seen nothin' 'till you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a changin' your ways""

I met a cheerleader
Was a real young bleeder
All the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things in lovin' with her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss like this

Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
I sing ""hey diddle, diddle""
Put your kitty in the middle of the swing
Like you didn't care

So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
And I know'd love was here to stay

When she told me to

Walk this way, walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way

Just gimme a kiss
Like this

School girl sweetie with a classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbin' way up her knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me

I was a high school loser, never made it with the ladies
'Till the boys told me somethin' I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss like this

Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
I sing ""hey diddle, diddle""
Put your kitty in the middle of the swing
Like you didn't care

So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way

She told me to

Walk this way, talk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, talk this way

Just gimme a kiss
Like this"
Rock,"In beautiful houses
With beautiful gardens
And beautiful friends inside
And I stand all alone
That rain falling down
I stare at your window and I cry
I love you so much
I love you too much
I love you so much so much
Will you be mine

In beautiful houses
With beautiful gardens
Where beautiful dreams have died
And you stand all alone
With your friends all around
And you stare at your window and you cry
I love you so much
I love you too much
I love you so much so much
Will you be mine

And I'm sorry for the things I said
Sorry for the things I did
Sorry for the way I said goodbye

I'm sorry for the things I said
Sorry for the things I did
Sorry that I ever made you cry-y-y

Well in beautiful houses
With beautiful gardens
And beautiful friends inside
And I stand all alone
With my world falling down
And I stare at your window and I cry
I love you so much
I love you too much
I love you so much so much
Will you be mine
I love you so much so much
Will you be mine

Oh darling

"
Rock,"What did I ever do for you, that you should die for me
And what did I ever give to you, that you should live in me
Now and forever and always true, your love has found a way
As I was, I am and always will be, will be

Be in my heart, be in my head, be in my soul tonight
Live in my words, let it be said, live in my life tonight

Pray that I never take in vain, the name I hold most dear
His love in very heart of me, casts out all doubt and fear
Now and forever and always true, your love has found a way
As I was, I am and always will be, will be

Be in my heart, be in my head, be in my soul tonight
Live in my words, let it be said, live in my life tonight

Tonight we shall sweetly sleep
Tonight by still waters deep
Tonight for my soul to keep, still waters lead me to your
Still waters, I need to drink of your still waters

Now that I know the kind of love that comes to fill me up
Fill me anew with love from you and overflow my cup
Now and forever and always true, your love has found a way
As I was, I am and always will be, will be

Be in my heart, be in my head, be in my soul tonight
Live in my words, let it be said, live in my life tonight

Still waters running deep
Still waters my soul to keep
Still waters it's your love flowing over me"
Rock,"i'll sing to the sun in the sky
i'll sing to the sun rises high

carnival time is here
magical time of year
and as the time draws near
dreams fill my heart

i'll sing while he plays his guitar
i'll sing as the night wakes the dawn
will love come my way
on this magical day
and will love stay in my heart

carnival time is here

Rock,"There was a time, the laughing time
I took my heart to every party
They'd point my way
""How are you today?""
""Will you make us laugh? Chase our blues away?""
Their funny man won't let them down
No, he'd dance and prance and be their clown
That time, the laughing time
When even a fool learns to love

The clown turned around
And saw her smile, Oh how she loved me
She'd clap her hands and beg me stay
To make her laugh, to make her life gay
Who wants the love of all the world
When here was love in the eyes of just one girl
That day, that precious day
When even a fool learns to love

But Oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to love

That day, that hateful day
The joke turned stale, the game was over
Those spiteful words ""Oh, go away. Who wants to play?""
""It's getting late now.""
My world, my funny world
Had lost its mask and shown a broken heart
A time, a sour time
When even a fool learns to love

But Oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream
"
Rock,"Isn't it nice when the rain comes falling
Turns into icicles, melting, mourning
Isn't it good when a friend comes calling 'round?

Isn't it good when you need somebody
People will help you not be lonely
Then you find someone who loves ya, only you

CHORUS:
But never take a love for granted
Give a little in return
Try to be understanding, live and learn

Isn't it good when the sun comes shining
Giving us warmth, see the children smiling
Just the reflections of love around their heart

Oh-o-o, just a start"
Rock,"Man, she punched me like a dude
Hold your mad hands, I cried
? Tis a pity she was a whore
? Tis my curse, I suppose
That was patrol
That was patrol
This is the war

Black struck the kiss, she kept my cock
Smote the mistress, drifting on
? Tis a pity she was a whore
She stole my purse, with rattling speed
That was patrol
This is the war
? Tis a pity she was a whore

? Tis a pity she was a whore

Man, she punched me like a dude
Hold your mad hands, I cried
? Tis a pity she? s was a whore
? Tis my face, I suppose
That was patrol
That was patrol
? Tis a pity she was a whore"
Rock,"We broke the rules together
I'm guilty for the crime
You call me up at 3am
To kill me one more time

We're dancing in slow motion
The house is set on fire
We hurt the ones we love the most
Tempted by desire

Smoke rings, tattoos, warning signs
Sink your teeth in, babe, be mine

Our love was like a stolen car
Racing down the freeway
Drinking for a new day
Wasted in an old dive bar
Nobody knew our names
Damn, those were the good days

We knew that it wouldn't last
But we did it to remember
Our love was like a stolen car
Pulled over on the freeway
'Cause it was never ours

The night knows every secret
The morning never tells
I'm not ready to leave yet
But you need somebody else

You kiss me on the forehead
As distance fills the room
Like holding on to water
You're always gone too soon

Smoke rings, tattoos, warning signs
Sink your teeth in, babe, be mine

Our love was like a stolen car
Racing down the freeway
Drinking for a new day
Wasted in an old dive bar
Nobody knew our names
Damn, those were the good days

We knew that it wouldn't last
But we did it to remember
Our love was like a stolen car
Pulled over on the freeway
'Cause it was never ours

Our love was like a stolen car
Racing down the freeway
Drinking for a new day
Wasted in an old dive bar
Nobody knew our names
Damn, those were the good days

Well, we knew that it wouldn't last
But we did it to remember
Our love was like a stolen car
Our love was like a stolen car
Our love was like a stolen car
Our love was like a stolen car, yeah, yeah
Pulled over on the freeway
'Cause it was never ours
Pulled over on the freeway
'Cause it was never ours

It was never ours (It was never ours)"
Rock,"Baker baker
Baking a cake
Make me a day
Make me whole again
And I wonder
What's in a day
What's in your cake this time
I guess you heard he's
Gone to LA
He says that behind
My eyes I'm hiding
And he tells me
I pushed him away
That my heart's been hard to find
Here
There must be something here
There must be something here
Here

Baker baker
Can you explain
If truly his heart
Was made of icing
And I wonder
How mine would taste
Maybe we could change his mind
I know you're late
For your next parade
You came to make sure
That I'm not running
Well I ran from him
In all kinds of ways
Guess it was his turn this time

Time
Thought I'd make friends with time
Thought we'd be flying
Maybe not this time

Baker baker
Baking a cake
Make me a day
Make me whole again
And I wonder
If he's ok
If you see him
Say hi

Rock,"There's so many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering, I'm lost
As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover

Many rivers to cross
And it's only my will that keeps me alive.
I've been hurt, washed up for years
But I mearly survive because of my pride

And this loneliness won't leave me alone,
It's such a drag to be on your own
My baby left, and she wouldn't say why,
Now all I do is cry...

I've got many rivers to cross
And it's only my will that keeps me alive
I've got so many rivers to cross,
Oh, so many rivers to cross...
"
Rock,"Just when I'm ready to throw in my hand
Just when the best things in life are gone
I look into your eyes

There's no smoke without fire
You're exactly who I want to be with
Without you
What would I do

And when I'm willing to call it a day
Just when I won't take another chance
I hold your hand
There's no smoke without fire
Woman I love you
Without you
What would I do"
Pop,"Ohh wooaah (3x)

You know you love me,I know you care
Just shout whenever, And I'll be there
You want my love, You want my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl quit playing!
""We're just friends""? What are you saying?
Said there's another and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time,

And I was like
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Baby, baby, baby no
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Thought you'd always be mine mine

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine, oh oh

For you, I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe, we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, But I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And im in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me til' you wake me from this bad dream

I'm going down, down, down
And I just can't believe
My first love won't be around

And I'm like
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine, oh oh

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine, oh oh

(Ludacris)
Luda!
When I was thirteen
I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came to between us or could ever come above
She had me going crazy
Oh I starstruck
She woke me up daily
Don't need no Starbucks
She make my heart pound
I skip a beat when
I see her in the street and
At school on the playground
But I really wanna
See her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazing
Cuz she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking
But I just keep on saying

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you`d always be mine, mine

And I was like
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you`d always be mine, mine

I'm gone
Yeah Yeah (5x)
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone, ooh
I'm gone, ooohh"
Rock,"Tears, all night long.
That's ok, I'm not strong.
I'm not strong enough, to live without her.

When will my baby see, how much she means to me?
When will my baby know, how much I love her?
I'm not strong enough, to live without her.
Whoa.........Whoa........Oh.........

Tears, all night long.
That's ok, I'm not strong.
I'm not strong enough, to live without her.

When will my baby see, how much she means to me?
When will my baby know, how much I love her?
I'm not strong enough, to live without her.
Whoa.........Whoa........Oh.........

Rock,"I feel fine
I feel fine
You were mine
I feel fine all the time

So take a look outside my window
I got a beautiful view

Have wheels will travel
Have wheels will travel
Have wheels will travel

I got time
I got time
On my side
I got time on my side

So take a look outside my window
I got a beautiful view

Have wheels will travel
Have wheels will travel
Have wheels will travel
Have wheels will travel

It's a beautiful view baby

Close my eyes
Close my eyes
For a while
Close my eyes for a while

So take a look outside my window
I got a beautiful view

Have wheels will travel
Have wheels will travel
Have wheels will travel
Have wheels will travel
Have wheels will travel
Have wheels will travel

You better close your eyes baby

Don't bring the milk in
Leave it on the porch
Don't read the papers
Don't mow the lawn no more
Drive to the market
At the break of dawn
Watch 'em unload the produce
Then ride right back home

It's the white man's burden
And it weighs a ton
I'm a family man
Model citizen

Torment the mailman
Terrorize the maid
Try to teach 'em some manners
Whip 'em into shape
Down in the basement
I've got a Craftsman lathe
Show it to the children
When they misbehave

It's the white man's burden
And it weighs a ton
I'm a family man
Model citizen

I'm a law-abiding man
I'm a good Samaritan
I pay my taxes when I can
Model citizen

In the cool of the evening
When the sun goes down
My wife's playing canasta
With everyone in town

When I feel the pressure
And I need a break
Load up the Winnebago
Drive it in the lake

It's the white man's burden
And it weighs a ton
I'm a family man
Model citizen

Pop,"Oh, I've been thinking about all the things
That we can do
When is me and you

And oh
Your body is calling me
I'll fulfill your needs
I can be your fantasy

We start it from the bed
Take it to the floor
Tell me what you need
Baby let me know
We don't need to rush
We can take it slow
Cause all this is for
You and me alone
Shut off all the phones
Roommate ain't home
Hope us to ourselves
Imma make it known
Ain't nobody else

You know that we will stay the night in
Cause I've been
Waiting for this love
No, I just can't enough

Would you wanna stay the night in
The time is right for me and you
Ain't no telling what we do

Got me talking love you
Got me talking love you
Now we're talking love you
I've been waiting for this love
Got me talking love you
Got me talking love you
Now we're talking love you
I've been waiting for this love

Let me talk to you
All the minutes I give
I wanted them in
And say I'm finished with you

We start it from the bed
Take it to the floor
Tell me what you need
Baby let me know
We don't need to rush
We can take it slow
Cause all this is for
You and me alone
Shut off all the phones

Got me talking love you
Got me talking love you
Now we're talking love you

And after all
The time we spent
You can have my heart
Time and time and time again

And through these nights
You've got me mesmerized
Thinking how do I get
Your body right here next to mine
And when the hours pass
And the feelings last
I fall in love
With the way you talk and the way you laugh
You know I've waited for this love

We gon' stay the night in
Cause I've been
Waiting for this love
No, I just can't enough
Would you wanna stay the night in
The time is right for me and you
Ain't no telling what we do

Got me talking love you

Now we're talking love you

Pop,"(Oh) I wonder what she's thinking when her eyes are closed
Hoping it's bout me, but I will never know

Plus a couple dollars when you wake up, call a cab
I really wanna wake her so that I could say goodbye
But what would be the point, cause

You don't have to leave
Rest your head, baby girl
You don't have to leave
Rest your head baby girl
When you open up your eyes
I'll be in the sky
Somewhere far away
Tryin to find my way
When you open up your eyes
I'll be in the sky
Somewhere far away
Tryin to find my way

Pop,"I don't mind spending some time
just hanging here with you 'cause
I don't find too many guys
that treat me like you do

Those other guys all wanna take me for a ride
but when I walk they talk of suicide
Some people never get beyond their stupid pride
but you can see the real me inside
and I'm satisfied

Even though the gods are crazy
even though the stars are blind
if you show me real love, baby
I'll show you mine

I can make you nice and naughty
like a devil and angel, too
Got a heart and soul and body
Let's see what this love can do

Baby, I'm perfect for you

No dejare que esto se acabe

Avansa y seduceme, y dile aquel
que es tu hombre
Mami duro grita mi nombre
W con la gatita de renombre
a lo onde de Puerto Rico hasta
Londre
Entonces Wiski en la Roca
yo borachito estas loca
Navegando en la troca, y vete
a pasiar de Cayey hasta Moca
Mua dandonos besitos en la boca

I could be your confidante
just one of your girlfriends
but I know that's not what you want
if tomorrow the world ends

Why shouldn't we be with the one we really love?
Now tell me who have you been dreaming of?
I am

Even though the gods are crazy
even though the stars are blind
if you show me real love, baby
I'll show you mine

I can make you nice and naughty
like a devil and angel, too
Got a heart and soul and body
Let's see what this love can do

Baby, I'm perfect for you

Excuse me for feeling
this moment is critical
It might be revealing
it could get physical

Oh no, no no

Even though the gods are crazy
even though the stars are blind
if you show me real love, baby
I'll show you mine

I can make you nice and naughty
like a devil and angel, too
Got a heart and soul and body
Let's see what this love can do

Let's see what love can do

Even though the gods are crazy
Even though the stars are blind"
Rock,"I've been working real hard trying to get my hands clean.
Tonight we'll drive that dusty road from Monroe to Angeline
To buy you a gold ring and a pretty dress of blue.
Baby just one kiss will get these things for you,
A kiss to seal our fate tonight,

A kiss to prove it all night, prove it all night,
Girl there's nothing else that we can do.
So prove it all night, prove it all night,
And girl I'll prove it all night for you.

Everybody's got a hunger, a hunger they can't resist.
There's so much that you want, you deserve much more than this.
But if dreams came true, oh wouldn't that be nice,
But this ain't no dream we're livin' all through tonight,
Ah girl you want it, you take it, you pay the price

To prove it all night, prove it all night,
Prove it all night baby and call the bluff.
Prove it all night, prove it all night,
And girl I'll prove it all night for your love.

(Solos)

Baby tie your hair back in a long white bow.
Meet me in the fields behind the dynamo.
You hear their voices tellin' you not to go.
They made their choices and they'll never know
What it means to steal, to cheat, to lie. What it's like to live and die...

To prove it all night, prove it all night,
Baby there's nothin' else that we can do.
So prove it all night, prove it all night,
Girl I'll prove it all night for you.

I'll prove it all night, I'll prove it all night.
I'll prove it all night, I'll prove it all night.

Rock,"(PARADISE BY THE SEA)

Well there's sparklin' angels on your fire-escape tonight
They line them up for you trying to keep you safe
But with them fire alley burglars on a midnight vamp
You lost your heart on Main Street to a beautiful tramp
That's all right, I don't mind
`Cause I got (you got) a love so fine
A love so fine, me and my baby
A love so fine, me and my baby
A love so fine

The rat's traps are filled with soul crusaders
Everybody's popping and hopping and jumping
At Little Melvin and The Invaders
You're out on the floor and you can't get up
Your baby's out there dancing and struttin' that Continental Strut
She looks so good, she looks so fine (she blows your mind)
Oh we (you) got a love so fine
A love so fine
A love so fine
A love so fine

Everybody's reeling when the band hits the ceiling
Don't you know you just wanna go
The boys start (joint gets) rockin', your knees start knockin'
Everybody party, go
Let's go

The bar's closed down (It's 3 o'clock and the bar's closed)
You walk to the shady side of town all alone (Well you walk along with your)
Papa's screaming at you, he wants some cash (baby to the dirty side of town)
Mama's chewing you (me) off about hanging out with (alley) trash
That's all right, oh you don't mind
'Cause you've got a love so fine, oh me and my baby
A love so fine
A love so fine
A love so fine

Pop,"I know what can I expect you're just a man
But even But even a man should understand his woman

I don't want you back, I don't want you back here with me
I don't wanna get back, get back to what we used to be
I just wanna be free, free to be what I wanna be
I just wanna be me, I just wanna be me and only me

This girl had so many things she couldn't tell you
This girl had so many things she couldn't show you so

Chorus

So it's time for me to show It's time to let you know
This is for real And this is what I feel

Chorus

I don't wanna see your face again
And I don't need to hear your lies
I don't even wanna hear your name
Oh boy, you better recognize

But I bought them brand new clothes and burned the skinny jeans
But she'll never know that I've made him better for her

So, give some credit
Where is due, give props to you know who
I gave him swag, I made him cool
He used to be a fool

So, give some credit
Where is due, give props to you know who
You know who, you know who
Give credit where is due

He holds her hand at the movies
Never stares at other boobies
I bet she thinks he's the one (she does!)

She should be thanking me and sending me some flowers
I thought him everything, now he can last for hours
But she'll never know that I've made him better for her

So, give some credit
Where is due, give props to you know who
I gave him swag, I made him cool
He used to be a fool

So, give some credit
Where is due, give props to you know who
You know who, you know who
Give credit where is due

Yo, he used to be whack
But I made him all that
What should've you think of my last name
I guess my Trainors' where is at
I had him brushed his teeth, even flossin'
Got him looking like Ryan Gosling
I guess that makes me pretty awesome
But I wasn't in love
So I toss him

So, give some credit
Where is due, give props to you know who
I gave him swag, I made him cool
Cause he used to be a fool

So, give some credit
Where is due, perharps you know who
You know who, you know who
Give credit where is due

Give me that credit, baby baby
Give me that credit, baby baby
Give me that credit, baby baby
'Cause you know who
Credit where is due, hey
You'll never know, you'll never know
He wasn't like this before
You'll never know, you'll never know
Unless you're hearing this song"
Pop,"Can we call a truce?
We both have our truths
And I just wish this god damn mess...
We could try and play it cool when it's going down
I don't wanna fight

Can we call a truce?
We both have our truths
And I just wish this god damn mess...
We could try and play it cool
I don't wanna fight, to lose you

I wrote a list of my demands
But I left it at a friend's
I rehearsed a little speech
But the whole thing got too preechy
So it seems like I'm back on scratch again
I read a magazine last night
All our issues came to light
I memorised it piece by piece, but I guess it's not that easy
Now it seems like I'm back on scratch again

And it seems like in all the fighting
We're losing sight
And it feels like all this time we once were tight
And it seems like we're supposed to be side by side
All I wanna do is set things right

Can we call a truce?
We both have our truths
And I just wish this god damn mess...
We could try and play it cool when it's going down
I don't wanna fight, I know I'm not right

Can we call a truce?
We both have our truths
And I just wish this god damn mess...
We could try and play it cool
I don't wanna fight, to lose you

I met you never asking sheer advice
To wise up and to make nice
I always thought she was a bore
But then that's another story
And I feel like I'm back on scratch again
And at this show the other night
I met your friend the skinny guy
I swear he tried to make a pass
I guess he never was too classy
And I feel like I'm back on scratch again

And it seems like in all the fighting
We're losing sight
And it feels like all this time we once were tight
And it seems like we're supposed to be side by side
All I wanna do is set things right

Can we call a truce?
We both have our truths
And I just wish this god damn mess...
We could try and play it cool when it's going down
I don't wanna fight, I know I'm not right

Can we call a truce?
We both have our truths
And I just wish this god damn mess...
We could try and play it cool
I don't wanna fight, to lose you

If we can't reconcile then
Can we just not fight?
Every second that you're gone I want you by my side
Another minute with you not around
I just might lose my mind
Was I wrong all the while or were you just not right?
We're supposed to be side by side
All I wanna do is set things right

Can we call a truce?
We both have our truths
And I just wish this god damn mess...
We could try and play it cool when it's going down
I don't wanna fight, I know I'm not right

Can we call a truce?
We both have our truths
And I just wish this god damn mess...
We could try and play it cool
I don't wanna fight, to lose you"
Pop,"I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I'm trying my best to be a man and be strong
I drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains
You're gone

Ever since I saw your face
Nothing in my life has been the same
I walk around just saying your name
Without you my world would end, yeah
I've searched around this whole damn place
And everything says you were meant to be
My girlfriend... oh

Bye bye

Bye bye
Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye
Bye bye
Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I had enough
It might sound crazy
But it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye"
Rock,"I knew I was never gonna talk to you tomorrow
And oh, the birds how they sing
If you were a bird could you sing me a song of sorrow
'Cause all I know from you is grief
But I never wanted to be your rolling train

I never wanted to be your dancin' shoes
I just wanted you to love me
I just wanted you to love me
Touch, feel & lose
And cry, cry, cry

I thought maybe I could be some kind of shelter
But oh, your storm how it raged
You know your kisses, they like lightnin' and thunder
And your smile is sweet and come down like rain

I never wanted to be your dancin' shoes
I just wanted you to love me
I just wanted you to love me
Touch, feel & lose
And cry, cry, cry
I just wanted you to love me, honey
Cry, cry, cry"

Oh, I don't need a invader to destroy me

Our love flows through
I can't explain
What you do
When I'm next to you
I feel brand new
I love you for
All the things you do

Pop,"So you leave tomorrow
Just sleep the night
I promise I will, make things right
I'll make you breakfast, the way you like
Before you leave tomorrow
Just let me try

Before you leave tomorrow
Before you say goodbye
Before you leave tomorrow
Before you leave

Stay here and lay here
Right in my arms
It's only a moment, before you're gone
And I, am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me, so I can go on

Just one more night
Lying in bed
Whether it's wrong or right
Just gotta make sense of it
And you'll be gone in the morning
And you'll be over this
Just one more night, so I can forget

Stay here and lay here
Right in my arms
It's only a moment, before you're gone
And I, am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me, so I can go on

When you go, I can't watch you leave
Just promise me you'll sneak out when I'm asleep
And when you go, and you're miles down the road
I wake up wishing everything was just a dream

Stay here and lay here
Right in my arms
It's only a moment, before you're gone
And I, am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me, so I can go on
Just act like you love me, so I can go on"
Rock,"I ain&acute;t got no time for nothin&acute; to do,
And I can&acute;t get ahead if I&acute;m watchin&acute; you, too.
Honey, all I do is wait for you.
People, all I do is wait for you.

Ain&acute;t got no lazybones around me,
&acute;couse you can&acute;t get ahead if you&acute;re behind, you see.

Goodbye, good luck, don&acute;t worry about me.

Goodbye, good luck, don&acute;t worry about me......

Pop,"You're running 'round in my head
While I'm run, run, running out of breath
Static hearts, electric
With a thunder no one will forget

You've got the moves
The spark that's driving me insane
Break all the rules
My heart is going up in flames

Daydreaming in the dark
You make my head go 'round, 'round, 'round

Hurricane, when the lights go out
Let it rain, let our hearts pour out
You got me 'til the sun burns out like
Ooh, ooh, ooh

We felt right, where we both be in love
Dynamite when you're in my arms
You and I make thunder storms like
Ooh, ooh, ooh

My heart in chains
While you're take, take, taking over me
Perfect storm, blown away
Our eyes strike lightning when they meet

You've got the moves
The spark that's driving me insane
Break all the rules
My heart is going up in flames

Daydreaming in the dark
You make my head go 'round, 'round, 'round

Hurricane, when the lights go out
Let it rain, let our hearts pour out
You got me 'til the sun burns out like
Ooh, ooh, ooh

We felt right, where we both be in love
Dynamite when you're in my arms
You and I make thunder storms like
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Walking on clouds
Away... way up here together
Not coming down
We could stay up here forever

Hurricane, when the lights go out
Let it rain, let our hearts pour out
You got me 'til the sun burns out like
('til the sun burns out, baby)

We felt right, where we both be in love
Dynamite when you're in my arms
You and I make thunder storms like
Ooh, ooh, ooh"

We're on the move
(Hey)
Ain't no stoppin' us now
We've got the groove
(Hey)
Mel, takeaway

There've been so many things that have held us down, down
But now it looks like things
Are finally comin' around, 'round
I know we've got a long, long way to go
And were we'll end up, I don't know

Don't you let nothin', nothin'

I want y'all to listen, listen

See ya after the break

Rock,"I met him at a party just a couple of years ago,
He was rather over-hearty and ridiculous
But as I'd seen him on the screen he cast a certain spell.
I'd basked in his attraction
For a couple of hours or so.
His manners were a fraction too meticulous,
If he was real or not, I couldn't tell,
But like a silly fool I fell

Mad about the boy,
I know it's stupid
To be mad about the boy.
I'm so ashamed of it
But must admit
The sleepless nights
I've had about the boy.

On the silver screen
He melts my foolish heart
In every single scene.
Although I'm quite aware
That here and there
Are traces of that cared about the boy.
Lord knows I'm not a fool girl,
I really shouldn't care.
Lord knows I'm not a schoolgirl
In the flurry of her first affair.
Will it ever cloy
This odd diversity of misery and joy
I'm feeling quite insane
And young again
And all because
I'm mad about the boy.

It seems a little silly
For a girl of my age and weight
To walk down Piccadilly in a haze of light.
It ought to take her a good deal more
To take a bad girl down.
I should've been exempt for my particular kind of fate
As taught me such contempt for every phase of love
And now I've been and spent my love torn crown
To weep about a painted clown.

Mad about the boy,
It's pretty funny
But I'm mad about the boy.
He has a gay appeal that makes me feel
There's maybe something sad about the boy.

Walking down the street
His eyes look out at me from people that I meet.
I can't believe it's true,
But when I'm blue, in some strange way
I'm glad about the boy.

I'm hardly sentimental,
Love isn't so sublime.
I have to pay my rental
And I can't afford to waste much time.
If I could employ a little magic
That would finally destroy
This dream that pains me and it shames me
But I can't because I'm mad about the boy.
"
Rock,"Hey, Mr. limousine driver,
Can I ask you a favor, please?
Let her in my door and don't look back here no more,
I know you can do it with ease.


Although, we're on our way from the show,
And you don't like to get off the track.
Please, Mr. chauffeur, let's talk things over,
'Cause she says she loves me and that's a fact.


Can you hear what I'm sayin', it's not like I'm prayin',
You know, because you've done it before.
So, why make me wait, please don't hesitate,
Just get back here, and let her in my door.


Hey, Mr. limousine driver,
I know you know where it's at.
Too late will be later, you just read your evening paper,
And don't worry 'bout what's goin' on in back.


Hey, Mr. limousine driver ...


Hey, Mr. limousine driver ...

"
Rock,"In a way, the sun has shone on me
Makes it easy, to make it hard
Take an inch, take a yard,
Take it all.
I don't need it, at all.

Any day, the sun could shine on you
Makes it silly, to make it bad
Take it good, take it glad,
Take it all.

Don't you know there's a stronger thing,
Keeping us together?
Don't you know there's a song to sing
Sing on, let the feeling take you high

[solo]

Don't you know there's a stronger thing,
Keeping us together?
Don't you know there's a song to sing
Sing on, let the feeling take you high

Any day, the sun will shine on you
Makes it silly, to take it bad
Make it good, take it glad,
Take it all.
I don't need it at all
I don't want it at all
No no no"
Rock,"I got two pins in my ankle and a busted collarbone
A steel rod in my leg, but it walks me home
At nine, I climbed high into the boughs
of our neighborhood's tallest tree
I don't remember the fear, just the breeze

Drive fast, fall hard, I'll keep you in my heart
Don't worry about tomorrow, don't mind the scars
Just drive fast, fall hard

At nineteen, I was the king of the dirt
down at the Remington draw
I liked the pedal and I didn't mind the wall
'Midst the roar of the metal I never heard a sound
I was looking for anything
any kind of drug to lift me up off this ground

Drive fast, fall hard, I'll keep you in my heart
Yeah, don't worry about tomorrow, don't mind the scars
Just drive fast, fall hard

We met on the set of this B picture that she made
She liked her guys a little greasy and 'neath her pay grade
We headed down to Baja in the desert
we made our stand of it
Figured maybe together we could get the broken pieces to fit

Drive fast, fall hard, keep me in your heart
Yeah, don't worry about tomorrow, don't mind the scars
Just drive fast, fall hard
I'll keep you in my heart
Yeah, don't worry about tomorrow, don't mind the scars
Just drive fast, fall hard

I got two pins in my ankle and a busted collarbone
A steel rod in my leg, but it walks me home"

CLIFF:
No more talk of darkness.
Forget these wide-eyed fears.
I'm here, nothing can harm you.
My words will warm and calm you.
Let me be your freedom.
Let daylight dry your tears.
I'm here, with you, beside you,
To guard you and to guide you.

Say you love me every waking moment.
Turn my head with talk of summertime.
Say you need me with you now and always.
Promise me that all you say is true.
That's all, I ask of you.

CLIFF:
Let me be your shelter.
Let me be your light.
You're safe, no one will find you.
Your fears are far behind you.

SARA:
All I want is freedom,
A world with no more night.
And you always beside me,
To hold me and to hide me.

CLIFF:
Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime.
Let me lead you from your solitude.
Say you want me with you here beside you.
Anywhere you go, let me go too.
That's all I ask of you.

Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime.

They get called assholes
This never happened to Pablo Picasso

Stop the looting, stop the shooting

Rock,"There's a down town fairy singing out ""Proud Mary""
as she cruises Christopher Street
And some Southern Queen is acting loud and mean
where the docks and the Badlands meet

This Halloween is something to be sure
Especially to be here without you

There's a Greta Garbo and an Alfred Hitchcock
and some black Jamaican stud
There's five Cinderellas and some leather drags
I almost fell into my mug

There's a Crawford, Davis and a tacky Cary Grant
And some Homeboys lookin' for trouble down here from the Bronx

But there ain't no Hairy and no Virgin Mary
you won't hear those voices again
And Johnny Rio and Rotten Rita
you'll never see those faces again

This Halloween is something to be sure
Especially to be here without you

There's the Born Again Losers and the Lavender Boozers
and some crack team from Washington Heights
The boys from Avenue B and the girls from Avenue D
a Tinkerbell in tights

This celebration somehow get me down
Especially when I see you're not around

There's no Peter Pedantic saying things romantic
in Latin, Greek or Spic
There's no Three bananas or Brandy Alexander
dishing all their tricks

It's a different feeling that I have today
Especially when I know you've gone away

There's a girl from Soho with a teeshirt saying ""I Blow""
she's with the ""jive five 2 plus 3""
And the girls for pay dates are giving cut rates
or else doing it for free

The past keeps knock, knock, knocking on my door
And I don't want to hear it anymore

No consolations please for feelin' funky
I got to get my head above my knees
But it makes me mad and mad makes me sad
and then I start to freeze

In the back of my mind I was afraid it might be true
In the back of my mind I was afraid that they meant you

At the Halloween parade
At the Halloween parade
See you next year, at the Halloween parade

Pop,"The moon is bright above
Oh, what a night for love
And as I hold you near
I whisper in your ear

I go ape every time I see you smile
I'm a ding dong gorilla and I'll carry you cave man style
I'm gonna bump you on the head and love you all the while

Well, I'm a monkey's uncle who's a cousin to a chimpanzee
Like I was reelin' and a rockin' and a swingin' from a coconut tree
Oh, honey can't you see you bring out the monkey business in me

Ranga tanga ring ting tong, I'm related to old King Kong
Honey won't you say you're mine
With a honky tonky monkey shine
When you hold my hand I'm a pre-historic man, I go ape!

Like a barrel on monkeys on an abadaba honeymoon
I go squealin' and a screechin' and a howlin' like a big baboon
Well baby I'll explode if you don't come and kiss me soon, yae yaa

Ohh, honey you know that I'm gonna be true to you
I'll keep you in bananas and bring you coconuts too
And we'll settle down in the nearest county zoo, woh

Ranga tanga ring ting tong, I'm related to old King Kong, woo
Honey won't you say you're mine
With a honky tonky monkey shine
When you hold my hand I'm a pre-historic man, I go ape!"

Next minute it's tearing you up
How is it that everything changed?
Why is it you're ruled by your pain?

But you don't know what you're fighting for
Don't try to make sense of it all
Go ahead, let go, you won't fall
Go ahead, let go, you won't fall

One minute you're free as a bird
Next minute you're caged and you're hurt
When one of those days leaves you lost
When everything you do is wrong

When it feels like you're fighting a war
But you don't know what you're fighting for
Don't try to make sense of it all
Go ahead, let go, you won't fall
Go ahead, let go, you won't fall
Go ahead, Go ahead, you won't fall

Pop,"As the sun rises it soon compromises the safety of night
And two travelers in spite of themselves
Have to push on

Mornings remind them of things left behind them
One a good wife and the other a life with no name
So they push on

Over the hills and the plains they ride
Sharing the unwritten law they abide
Two uncharted hearts in the silence of their own flight

The journey they measure in danger and pleasure
One likes to bluff and the other is tough on the girls
Still they push on

Roll the bones
Devil-may-care
No questions asked
Barely friends
Two solitaires
Needing each other out there

They build a good fire before they retire
Searching the flame for a moment of blameless repose
A way to push on
Lessons come hard on this brave terrain
They may run free but they're still in the rain
Two uncharted hearts in the silence of their own flight"
Rock,"I HOLD YOU IN MY ARMS
AS THE BAND PLAYS
WHAT ARE THOSE WORDS WHISPERED BABY
JUST AS YOU TURN AWAY
I SAW YOU LAST NIGHT
OUT ON THE EDGE OF TOWN
I WANNA READ YOUR MIND
TO KNOW JUST WHAT I´VE GOT IN
THIS NEW THING I´VE FOUND

SO TELL ME WHAT I SEE
WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES
IS THAT YOU BABY
OR JUST A BRILLIANT DISGUISE

I HEARD SOMEBODY CALL YOUR NAME
FROM UNDERNEATH OUR WILLOW
I SAW SOMETHING TUCKED IN SHAME
UNDERNEATH YOUR PILLOW
WELL I´VE TRIED SO HARD BABY
BUT I JUST CAN´T SEE
WHAT A WOMAN LIKE YOU
IS DOING WITH ME

SO TELL ME WHO I SEE
WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES
IS THAT YOU BABY
OR JUST A BRILLIANT DISGUISE

NOW LOOK AT ME BABY
STRUGGLING TO DO EVERYTHING RIGHT
AND WHEN IT ALL FALLS APART
WHEN OUT GO THE LIGHTS
I´M JUST A LONELY PILGRIM
I WALK THIS WORLD IN WEALTH
I WANNA KNOW IF IT´S YOU I DON´T TRUST
´CAUSE I DAMN SURE DON´T TRUST MYSELF

NOW YOU PLAY THE LOVING WOMAN
I´LL PLAY THE FAITHFUL MAN
BUT JUST DON´T LOOK TOO CLOSE
INTO THE PALM OF MY HAND
WE STOOD AT THE ALTAR
THE GYPSY SWORE OUR FUTURE WAS RIGHT
BUT COME THE WEE WEE HOURS
WELL MAYBE BABY THE GYPSY LIED

SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME
YOU BETTER LOOK HARD AND LOOK TWICE
IS THAT ME BABY
OR JUST A BRILLIANT DISGUISE

TONIGHT OUR BED IS COLD
I´M LOST IN THE DARKNESS OF OUR LOVE
GOD HAVE MERCY ON THE MAN
WHO DOUBTS WHAT HE´S SURE OF.

Rock,"I've sailed an ocean
I've sailed an ocean before you

Feeling joy that I never knew before
Let's celebrate this better day

I've climbed a mountain
I've climbed a mountain before you
Thought I was wise
Thought I was wise before I met you

Won't ever leave you
And I am so lost in love
That every day I'm waiting for you

Just want to be with you
Just want to be where you are,
It's all I need
And we'll celebrate this better day

This destiny
Has been designed for me by someone
This mystery
Has all the signs to make me hold on

There'll come a day I know now
A better day when we will belong together
It's just a touch away now
Just a kiss and we will be there

I just want to here with you
Just want to be with you
Just want to be where you are,
It's all I need
And we'll celebrate this better day

It's just a touch away now
Just a kiss and we will be there

I just want to here with you
Just want to be with you
Just want to be where you are,
It's all I need
And we'll celebrate this better day

This better day
This better day"
Rock,"From childhood's hour I have not been
As others were â€” I have not seen
As others saw â€” I could not bring
My passions from a common spring.
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow; I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone;
And all I lov'd, I lov'd alone.
Then â€” in my childhood â€” in the dawn
Of a most stormy life â€” was drawn
From ev'ry depth of good and ill
To mystery which binds me still:
From the torrent, or the fountain,
From the red cliff of the mountain,
From the sun that 'round me roll'd
In its autumn tint of gold â€”
From the lightning in the sky
As it pass'd me flying by â€”
From the thunder and the storm,
And the cloud that took the form
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)
"
Rock,"Oh, fare thee well, I must be gone
And leave you for a while.
If ever I go I will return
If I go ten thousand miles.

If I go
If I go
If I go ten thousand miles.

Ten thousand miles it is so far
To leave me here alone
While I may lie lament and cry
And you'll not hear my moan.

And you
No, you
And you'll not hear my moan.

The crow that is so black, my love,
Will change its colour white.
If I ever should prove false to thee
The day will turn to night.

Oh the day
Yes, the day
Oh the day will turn to night.

The rivers never will run dry
Or the rocks melt with the sun.
I'll never prove false to the boy I love
Till all these things be done.

Till all
Till all
"
Rock,"Let's all go downtown,
I got friends doing nothing but hanging around...well
I feel like there's something I could be missing.
You know you look alright,
You got cheap shoes, and Malibu, and big public fights,
Well, there's no one else I would rather be kissing.
Baby when you start to bleed, you look so sweet.
Everybody's watching you cause everybody wants to be

Little superstar. Well baby that's what you are.
Little superstar. Oh honey that's what you are.

I got a backstage line,
I call you up been watching you for quite some time...Well
I beat around the streets like Bandini looking for Camilla.
I'll be satin and speed,
If you and I are still alive we'll get off these streets...Well
There was a time I would've hung around just to be seen.
Hey man, it's a shame when you start to fade.
Diamond rings and sparkily things won't make your shine stay.

My little superstar. Oh baby that's what you are.
My little superstar. Oh honey you break my heart.
My little superstar. Oh honey you know you are.
My little superstar. Oh honey you break my heart.

Oh. Hey man, well it's a shame when you fade away.
Diamond rings and sparkily things won't make your shine stay.

My little superstar. Oh baby that's what you are.
My little superstar. Oh honey you break my heart.
My little superstar. Oh honey you know you are.
My little superstar. Oh honey you break my heart.
"
Rock,"Today I saw the strangest thing on the evening news
A man who wasn't sad at all about what's going on
And even though I'm trying to smile
With everything I see it could take a while

Chorus:
I've been looking everywhere I go
Where has all the love, where has all the love gone?
I've been looking all around to know
Where has all the love, where has all the love gone?

Yesterday I heard you say you never close your eyes
Sometimes the world's a scary ride, it's hard to hang on
Along the way we got off track
And if we turn around can we ever get back?

Chorus

You say it was there when we were young
Today I saw a flag roll by on a wooden box
And if it's true we lost our way
Then what have we got?

Chorus 2x

Today I saw the strangest thing"
Pop,"(Elliot Wolff / Howie Hersh /Da' Count / Paula Abdul / Robb Boldt / Jesse Greer / Irving Mills / Cab Calloway / Clarence Gaskill)

Chorus:
That's what I want
That's what I need
That's what I want
Ho-down

She sprays her lies around her like the clouds release the rain
And endless stream of promises that vaporize again
Remember last Tuesday when you said it was the end
You caught her in your Nissan getting funky with your best friend
She will never change till her flesh is under dirt
But then at least she's hangin' with neighbors she deserves
Forgive me if I seem to sound a little on the loose
But I cannot pour sugar just to sweeten up the truth

I would like to wish her to a long forgotten dream
Happened early morning when I was just two or three
Everyone around who didn't quite fit in the mix
Turned and waved goodbye and disappeared without a hitch
Except my friend Billy who live just across the way
The world belonged to us forever on from that day
Until we ran into that sneaky girl from down the street
Who tried to smile so pretty stealing Billy right from me

Chorus

The world spun around her everywhere that she would go
But even my friend Billy knew that she was just a - oh no
She had such a way to twist and turn a simple truth
Told my friend Billy I had been a little loose
Then Billy took her by the arm and left me standing all along
I just had to wait there watching them do-se-do
Till Billy pushed her in the deepest darkest hole around
It was goodbye sneaky girl - ho down

I would like to wish her for her a place to somewhere far
A place in outer space to some exotic little star
A million miles away would probably suit the planet fine
Someplace where it's clear she is gone and you are mine
Or maybe some romantic little island in the sea
As far away as it is possible to be
She can have the flowers and the wind
And I can have my baby back with me once again

Chorus

I would like to wish for her another little story
My daddy said to me when I was just a little girly
He told me 'bout a pretty graceful lovely lady bird
Who never could find a nest good enough for her
From every tree she landed in she saw one that was better
So off she went before she ever could regain her breath
Wasn't it a pity when she finally hit the ground
It was goodbye lovely birdy - ho down
"
Rock,"Think of a time
When morning will come
And you will wake up without the feeling
That half the world has gone insane
You'll open your eyes
Reading your paper, a drink from your cup
No one was burning down time
while you were sleeping

I'd never seen but I believe
In a promised land

Why can't we pull this together?
One and all, now and forever
Why can't we pull this together?
We can say we finally found a world that's
safe and sound

Think of a place
that you could believe in whatever you want
Not keep it secret
And have to risk your life just to be yourself
A place where you'll walk safely
no matter your color or age
More than the greed of you and me
Defines a better day

I'd never seen but I believe
In a promised land

Why can't we pull this together?
One and all, now and forever
Why can't we pull this together?
We can say we finally found a world that's safe and sound

I'd rather see you setting free than watch the curtains coming down

Think of a life you won't take the breath from somebody else
One that you're seeking more than yourself

Why can't we pull this together?
One and all, now and forever
Why can't we pull this together?
We can say we finally found a world that's safe and sound

Why can't we pull this together?
Now and forever
Pull this together
We can say we finally found a world that's safe and sound

I'd rather see you setting free than watch the curtains coming down..."
Pop,"Strange fear I ain't felt for years
The boys comin' and I'm close to tears
I can't let go
Of you now

Imagination's playing out for free
In my world I take him out for tea
Oh my god
He can't say no

Train comes I don't know it's destination (I'll sleep with any man)
It's a one way ticket to a mad man situation (Situation)
Train comes I don't know it's destination (I know I know)
It's a one way ticket to a mad man situation (got me feeling sad)

When your still in my face
You're messing with my brain
If you're trying to convince me
Then you better think again
If you move to my music
The music's got to give
If I'm too complicated
That's the way I want to live

People moving, bodies grooving
Never ending
Place is moving
(Don't you worry 'bout a thing all you need is off your sting)
All my girls are here with me
Worry now they've got their need
(Do you feel me, do you feel me, do you feel me, do you feel me)
Woo

Round, round baby round, round
Spend the night on me
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free
Realise the vibe gonna be down low
I don't need nobody but my honeys
When I go

Round, baby when I go
When I go
(When I go)
When I go
(When I go)
When I go
When I go round baby
(When I go)
When I go
(When I go)
When I go
(When I go)
When I go
When I go

You look into my eyes
I go out of my mind
I can't see anything
Cause this love's got me blind
I can't help myself
I can't break the spell
I can't even try

I'm in over my head
You got under my skin
I got no strength at all
In the state that I'm in

And my knees are weak
And my mouth can't speak
Fell too far this time

OOh, baby, baby, baby

Baby, I'm too lost in you
Caught in you
Lost in everything about you
So deep, I can't sleep
I can't think
I just think about the things that you do (you do)
I'm too lost in you (too lost in you)
OOh

When I was 7
They said I was strange
I noticed that my eyes and hair weren't the same
I asked my parents if I was Ok
They said you're more beautiful
And that's the way they show that they wish that
They had your smile
So my confidence was up for a while
I got real comfortable with my own style
I knew that they were only jealous cos

People are all the same
And we only get judged by what we do
My personality reflects me
And if I'm ugly then
So are you
So are you

Cooler than the red dress
Coz I'm cooler
Coz I'm cooler
Coz I'm cooler than the red dress
Coz I'm cooler
Coz I'm cooler

And when you're sure
You'll never let her play you again
She'll put on your favourite smile
Unplug the phone to get you alone
Dirty dance
Her hips will send you into a trance

Coz I'm cooler than the red dress
I'd rather catch a guy on my own (let me get it)
Coz what you see the man gets (don't forget it)
And if you don't I'm better off here alone

Ow, ow, ow

Done the candlelight to make you stay over
I'm giving it up now, baby (oh now)
If that's what I've got to do to just own ya (own ya)
I'm giving it up now, maybe (I'm giving, I'm giving)
Baby, Baaby

I'm caught up in the middle
Jumping through the riddle
I'm falling just a little tonight (uh uh uh)

At night it's on the low
No front just sing the flow
We're speaking all in code
To get to the place we know
Sweat running down my back
I'm wearing leather, black
Falling into a trap
There is no turning back

I got my ladies with me
Fellas get cool and freaky
But we've gotta keep him tame
Cos we don't wanna play that game

Everybody from the block
Needs to be feeling nice
It ain't no weakest party
But get up enjoy the ride
What you see and what you hear
Can never be exposed
Acting out of character
Is everything we know

I'm caught up in the middle
Jumping through the riddle
I'm falling just a little tonight (uh uh uh)
Cos everybody's making trouble
Someone's burst their bubble
But we'll be getting by alright (uh uh uh)

Eleven hours on a brand new day
I'm getting ready to go out and play
It's late at night, I'm caught in a groove
I'd kiss my ass before I'm feeling blue

Why don't you cry
For the day
Say goodbye
Runaway
Why don't you cry
For the day
Say goodbye
I said ok, 'cos

Ooh, won't you miss me like a hole in the head
Because I do boy (I do)
And it's cool boy (yeah it's cool)
And ooh, bet you never thought I'd get out of bed
Because of you boy, (I do boy)
Such a fool boy (such a fool)

AAhh
Runaway
AAhh
I said ok

You were like a power of nature
Telephatic beautiful creature
Understanding all my weakness
Patient, loving, knowing you'd reach it

Cynical and that was just me
You were never supposed to be
Part of what I would call amazing
It took so long to finally see

I didn't want to fall in love with you
I didn't want to know the things I knew
It wasn't until I look into the mirror
To Denial

Anything that you want boy (you know I got it)
Anytime that you need it (you know I'm on it)
Anything that you want boy (you know I got it)
Anytime that you need it (you know I'm on it)

Anything that you want boy (you know I got it)
Anytime that you need it (you know I'm on it)
And whenever you're gone boy (I just can't stand it)
You just make me lose my mind

Ooh-Ohh

Come on baby
I'll make it easy
Come on honey
I'll make it so easy for you

Let me lay it on the line
I got a lil freaky-ness inside
And u know that a mans gotta deal with it
I dont care what they say
Im not bout to pay anybodys way
Coz its al bout the dark in me -mmhrmm

I wanna freak in the mornin, freak in the evenin
Just like me
I need a rough neack brother who can satisfy me
Just for me
If you are that kind of man
Coz im that kind of girl
I gotta freaky secret everybody sing
Coz we dont give a damn about a thing

Coz I will b a freak untill the day untill the dawn
And we can -pump pump
All through the night to the early morn
Cum on and I will take ya round the hood on a gangsta lean
Coz we can -pump pump
Anytime of days its all good for me
(its all good for me)

Push the button
Push the button
Its all good for me
Push the button
Push the button

I'm busy showing him what he's been missing
I'm kind of showing off for his full attention
My sexy ass has got him in the new dimension
I'm ready to do something to relieve this mission

After waiting patiently for him to come and get it
He came on through and asked me if I wanted to get with him
I knew I had my mind made up from the very beginning
Won't miss this opportunity so you and me could feel it 'cos

(Push The Button, baby) If you're ready for me boy
You'd better
(Push The Button, baby) push the button and let me know
(Push The Button, baby)
Before I get the wrong idea and go you're gonna
(Baby)
Miss the freak that I control

Push the button
Push the button
I've been dropping so many hints
(Push the button)
You're still not getting it
(Push the button)
Now that you've heard everything I have to say
(Push the button)
Where we gonna go from here?
(Push the button)

It was so easy that night
Should have been strong, yeah I lied
Nobody gets me like you

Could I keep hold of you then
How could I know what you meant
It was not meant to compare to

I know everything changes
All the cities and faces
But I know how I feel about you

There's a mountain between us
But theres one thing I'm sure of
That I know how I feel about you

Can we bring yesterday back around
'cause I know how I feel about you now
Can we bring
About you now

Can we bring yesterday back around
'cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb I was wrong
I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now
Noow

Can we bring
About you now
Can we bring
About you now"
Rock,"C'mon baby,
Yeah, big ol' wet one...hey!

Kiss my ass,
Kiss my ass, (c'mon, everybody ought'a)
Kiss my ass, (tastes real good)
Kiss my ass. (oh...)

Don't waste your time on me
I got my own direction
Watch me close, wait and see
I'm lookin' for perfection
I make up my own mind
And I'll leave you far behind
When the goin' gets tough
You can kiss my ass

I believe in animal rights
I let my dog hump on my shin
I can tolerate sexual choice
But not with the next of kin (uh-uh, boy)
I've heard it all before
I ain't gonna take any more
When the goin' gets tough
You can kiss my ass

Everybody!
Kiss my ass, (pucker up)
Kiss my ass
Kiss my ass
Kiss my ass, (c'mon babe)

I've heard it all before
And I ain't gonna take no more, no no
When the goin' gets tough
Kiss my ass!

I see the weenies with the dirty hair
Protestin' on the street
They condemn the clothes we wear
And the morality of what we eat, yeah
It's gotta be a fluke
They make me wanna puke
When the goin' gets tough
They can kiss my ass

Everybody gotta
Kiss my ass - C'mon gang bangers
Kiss my ass - Janet Reno

Kiss my ass - Callin' on Jesse Jackson
Kiss my ass - How about the IRS

And we ain't gonna take it no more
When the goin' gets rough
When the goin's to tough
When the goin' gets rough
They oughta' kiss my ass"
Rock,"Never been to London, never been to France
never was sorry never learned to dance
Never walked down to 42nd Street and Frairs
never smoked any filtered air

Guess it's true what all the people say
gonna have to mend my old time ways, yeah
I guess it's true, guess, I've lived a sheltered life

Never walked about on the streets at night
never got into an uptown fight
Never smoked a hookah, never saw a rug
couldn't even squash a beetle bug

Guess it's true I'm gonna have to change my ways
guess it's true what all the people say, yeah
I know it's true, guess, I've lived a sheltered life

Never went to parties in a chauffeured car
never wore a top hat 'cause I won't get far
Never learned to handle all the things that I've seen
maybe I'll grow up to be big and mean

Guess it's true what all the people say
gonna have to change my old fashioned ways, well
I guess it's true, guess, I've lived a sheltered life


"
Rock,"I'll say it straight and plain
I know I've made mistakes
I've always been afraid
I've always been afraid

A thousand nights or more
I travelled east and north
Please answer the door

Can you tell me
You say that love goes anywhere
In your darkest time, it's just enough to know it's there
When you go, I'll let you be
But you're killing everything in me

Get down on your knees
Whisper what I need
Something pretty
Something pretty

I feel that when I'm old
I'll look at you and know
The world was beautiful

Then you tell me
You say that love goes anywhere
In your darkest time, it's just enough to know it's there
When you go, I'll let you be
But you're killing everything in me

I'm done, there's nothing left to show
Try but I can't let go
Are you happy where you're standing still?
Do you really want the sugar pill?
I'll wake up tomorrow and I'll start
To another, it feels so hard
As a train approaches, getting on
As I'm sure your kiss remains employed
Am I only dreaming?

You say that love goes anywhere
In your darkest time, it's just enough to know it's there
When you go, I'll let you be
But you're killing everything in me

When you go, I'll let you be
But you're killing everything in me"
Pop,"Poor Shirley
She must hide her tears
For nobody wants to see them
Surely it will break her heart
Time passes as she waits for a friend

We'll take all the doubtful ones in the fight
And make them hold off 'til the spring
Take hold of their hallowed souls
And save them from pain
All of the pain
Save ourselves from all of the pain


Dearly held are the friends
Left in the years and lost in the war
Dearly held are the loves
Save for the ones you lose on your own


Stars will light up the lonely nights
Harbor lights
Making us believe in the love
So struck by the hope of the harmony
Leaving the sorrow
Gently


Poor Shirley
She must hide her tears
For nobody wants to see them
Surely she will win a heart
Time passes as she waits for the wind

"
Pop,"Frozen in time
But in my mind there's no erasing you
I toss and I turn
It's gonna hurt no matter what I do

I'm trembling inside, no
I can't stop myself from shaking
Even though I know you take my heart and break it
You'd break it

But every kiss and every breathless moment
(I'd do it all again)
Trying to make it right, but I know it'll all go wrong
(I'd do it all again)
Cause I can't lie
I love you still for all my life I always will
Even though I know how the story ends
I'd do it all again

Oh, babe
Remembering when you made me dance
around the living room
It still makes me smile
I don't know how to let go of you

But now that you're gone
I can't stop myself from crying
I gotta move on, but I'm not strong
I'll keep on trying, I'm trying

But every kiss and every breathless moment
(I'd do it all again)
Trying to make it right but I know it'll all go wrong
(I'd do it all again)
Cause I can't lie
I love you still for all my life and I always will
Even though I know how the story ends
I'd do it all again

And I hate how much I still love you such a tragedy
It's impossible to comprehend this hold you got on me

But every kiss and every breathless moment
Trying to make it right but I know it'll all go wrong
'Cause I can't lie
I love you still for all my life yeah and I always will
Even though I know how the story ends

But every kiss and every breathless moment
(I'd do it all again)
Trying to make it right but I know it'll all go wrong
(I'd do it all again)
Cause I can't lie
I love you still for all my life and I always will
Even though I know how the story ends
I'd do it all again
I'd do it all again"
Rock,"Well, mister, you see that girl walking down the street
That little girl, she used to turn 'em on
Wild kisses and a heart that's oh-so-sweet
In the middle of the night.

Afraid to get my feet back on the ground

Rock,"I'm waiting for my man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington, 125
Feel sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for my man

Hey, white boy, what you doin' uptown?
Hey, white boy, you chasin' our women around?
Oh pardon me sir, it's the furthest from my mind
I'm just lookin' for a dear, dear friend of mine
I'm waiting for my man

Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
PR shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for my man

Up to a Brownstone, up three flights of stairs
Everybody's pinned you, but nobody cares
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
Ah then you gotta split because you got no time to waste
I'm waiting for my man

Baby don't you holler, darlin' don't you bawl and shout
I'm feeling good, you know I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling oh so fine
Until tomorrow, but that's just some other time
I'm waiting for my man
"
Rock,"I keep my focus on the simple things
Try to find some peace along the way
Wish I knew how long I'm supposed to wait
Holding on
But just barely

Got the feeling I've been talking to a dead, dead line
Always a reason
Let it change
Is there anyone there?
Listening while you cry, cry, cry?
Always a reason for the pain
I'm doing the things I've been told everyday
Then why does it feel like I'm moving in place?

Never had anything to prove
But never was anyone like you
All you fought through
All you had to face
Made you stronger, unafraid

Got the feeling I've been talking to a dead, dead line
Always a reason
Let it change
Is there anyone there?
Listening while you cry, cry, cry?
Always a reason for the pain
I'm doing the things I've been told everyday, everyday, everyday
Then why does it feel like I'm moving in place, in place, in place?

I gotta believe that you're there
When I sing, when I sing, when I sing
Cause if you're not real then I'm losing my head
my head, my head

Got the feeling I've been talking to a dead, dead line
Always a reason
Let it change
Is there anyone there?
Listening while you cry, cry, cry?
Always a reason for the pain
I'm doing the things I've been told everyday, everyday, everyday
Then why does it feel like I'm moving in place, in place, in place?

I gotta believe that you're there
When I sing, when I sing, when I sing
Cause if you're not real then I'm losing my head
my head, my head

I keep my focus on the simple things
Trying to find some peace along the way"

But I'm Prepared to Kick It
(Something Like Dying
Yes I Loved You More Than Life Itself
But I'm Prepared to Kick It"
Pop,"I can see pouring rain
See my future heading for the drain
So bet'cha wondering
Why I got a grin permanently on my face

Stumbling downhill fast
Wasting time that I just don't have
But still I got a smirk
Like I'm up in first
When I'm in economy class

And I could be on my knees
Going from bad to worse
And all a my hopes and dreams
Come crashing down to earth
No matter how bad it seems...

Any time I wake up and I see your face
Every single morning it's a sunny day
Don't know how I ever lived life without you
But girl you got me running to the highest place
So they can hear me screaming from miles away
Gotta tell the world how I feel about you
Tell the world

This ladder I'm 'bout to climb
Need the highest roof I can find
I'm headed for the top
Dodging all the rocks
Till I hit the clear blue sky

Every day I keep it to myself
I'm doing damage to my mental health
If I don't let it go think I might explode
If I don't get help

What a wonderful feeling
She got me up s high feel like I'm touching
The ceiling
I can touch the sky me and the birds are chilling
Yeah you got that lottery love - one in a million
One of a kind, many men spend their whole lifetime
Searching for the special someone but it
Ain't my girl
So I don't care if they look at me weird
I know just what I got and I'ma tell the world"
Rock,"Don't ask me to love my neighbour
Cause I don't love the man
Don't ask me for my favours
I won't lend a hand
And if I had real power
Then I could disappear
Wouldn't have to be around you
I'd sink into the atmosphere

Then I wouldn't hear
Your hard luck story
It's a hard luck, a hard luck story

Don't ask me to tip the waiter
For he is underhand
I can tell he is a woman hater
And he is a nasty man
Within reach lies all desire
For each and every soul
Stripped bare and stretching higher
You fall into the last balck hole

To end your hard
Hard luck story
It's a hard luck
Hard luck story

Don't ask me to pray to Jesus
I've never met the man
I only meet weekend preachers
Pictures of the promised land
All the new holy saviours
Who pretend to understand
Who do you think will save you
Modern day beggar man

Such a hard luck
Hard luck story
It's a hard luck
Hard luck story

It's such a hard
Hard luck story
It's a hard luck
Hard luck story

Don't ask me to love my neighbour
Don't ask me to tip the waiter
Don't ask me to pray to Jesus
He picked his time to leave us

It's a hard luck
Hard luck story
It's a hard luck
Hard luck story
It's a hard luck story
Hard luck story

Pop,"The Stylistics Cover

There's a spark of magic in your eyes
Candyland appears each time you smile
Never thought that fairy tales came true
But they come true when I'm near you

You're a genie in disguise
Full of wonder and surprise and...

Chorus:
Betcha by golly wow
You're the one that I've been waiting for forever
And ever will my love for you keep growing strong
Keep growing strong

If I could, I'd catch a falling star
to shine on you so I'd know where you are
Putt a rainbow in your favorite shade
to show I love you, thinking of you

Write your name across the sky
Anything you ask, I'll try cuz..."
Rock,"You may have diamonds
You may have pearls
You may think you got it baby
Over all the other girls
But honey you ain't got nothing
And I'll tell you why
If you're empty as a soul can be, baby
Deep down inside

You better start savin' up
For the things that money can't buy
You better start savin' up
For the things that money can't buy
You better start savin' up
For the things that money can't buy
You better start savin' up
For the things that money can't buy

You may have a big backyard
And ruby rings
And my love's just a second-place runner, honey
To your fancy things
But what you got to hold on to
When the lights go down
You come lookin' for me baby
But I ain't nowhere around

You better start savin' up
For the things that money can't buy
You better start savin' up
For the things that money can't buy
You better start

You need a strong man, baby
To love and understand you
A man who ain't afraid, sugar
To get some dirt on his hands for you
And when you're feeling so down-hearted
And all you wanna do is cry
Ah, just come on, take my hand, baby
Together you and I

We could start savin' up
For the things that money can't buy
We'd better start savin' up
For the things that money can't buy
You better start savin' up
For the things that money can't buy
You better start savin' up
For the things that money can't buy

Chorus
Oh, I'm lost in a one story town
Where everything's close to the ground
Yeah the same shit goes down
Nothing turns around
It's a one story town --

She was only seventeen
But I held her to her word
Had to push her luck
Thought she couldn't burn

No, it didn't hurt me
When she had to leave
She had a far away feeling
Wasn't part of me

Rock,"Spent all of his life in love with money
Never found love he never got lucky no
One hundred are the times he tried
And every time he lost a part of him died

Love can be found the people would tell
So he threw his heart
In the wishing well

Young Julie the girl from the city
With eyes full of pain and a heart
Full of pity yeah and she said...

No use cryin' 'bout your living dying
You're gotta make your peace
And and let your livin' just ease along
Let your livin' just ease along
You've got to give up livin' your life like a demon
Find your heart and the why, and the where,
And the reason
Oh - oh - oh

She took him up the mountain side
Where the air was clear and the water was wine
She loved him when the night was still
And the stars danced on the window sill
And over and over again
The lovers looked out from the mountain rim
There was no need to reach for the stars
You could catsh them all night and keep them in jars
And she told him...

No use cryin' 'bout your living dying
You're gotta make your peace
And and let your livin' just ease along
Let your livin' just ease along
You've got to give up livin' your life like a demon
Find your heart and the why, and the where,
And the reason

Ease along you've got to ease along
Spent all his life in love with money-ease along
Never found love never got lucky-ease along
With eyes full of pain and her heart full of pity-
ease along
Young Julie the girl from the city said-ease along"
Rock,"So much for the days of glory
It's not like your idols died and are holy now
You cross the street and count to ten
And everyone that mattered went to bed
Or maybe they died

Welcome home
Miss So Unknown
Bet you want it back
They all want it back, but you can't have it
You've lost total control

The sun, it lights the blades of grass
It's not like she knows the difference or cares
She's stupid and cold
Somewhere in the waves of doubt
It's not like she swam awhile, then faded out
So stupid and calm

Welcome home
Miss So Unknown
Do you want it back?
Welcome home
Miss So Unknown
They all want it back, when they want it all back
But you can't have it
You've lost control

Rock,"Some couples live in harmony
some do not
Some couples yell and scream
some do not

But what you said was something
that I can't forget
It echoes in my head
like a bullet made of lead

Some people yell and scream
and some do not
Some people sacrifice their lives
and some do not

Some people wait for sleep
to take them away
While others read books endlessly
hoping problems will go away

I know you're hoping everything
works out
Neither one of us is
the type who shouts

You sleep in the bedroom
while I pace up and down the hall
Our baby stares at both of us
wondering which one of us to call

I guess it's true that not
every match burns bright
I guess it's true
not all that I say is right

But what you said still bounces
around in my head
Who thought this could happen to us
when we first went to bed

I'm told in the end
that none of this matters
All couples have troubles
and none of this matters

But what you said
still echoes in my head
And I'm still in the hallway
downstairs sleeping alone instead

I know you don't care
but here's my last thought
Not that it matters
but here's the last thing I thought

Our little thing is lying
here in tatters
And you my dear
don't have any manners

Sad to leave this way
to leave it all in tatters
Saddening to leave this way
to leave it all in tatters
I suppose that we all could say
that nothing of it matters
Still it's sad
to see everything in tatters


"
Pop,"I get the feeling that we are being lied to
There’s a surge in my psychosis every turn of the screw
And I’m half awake in paisley print
I can see the world clearly but I have to squint
I am a supersonic specimen
A minor miracle of medicine
I’m at the mercy of unwanted emotions
Where nothing matters
Beneath my thoughts
Beneath my thoughts is where it happens
Super heavy elements
Embrace me
Super heavy elements
Replace me
Was it a positive experiment
To be indefinitely decadent

And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope
That there was no truth to what was wrote
Give me half as much but twice as fast or today
Might slip away

I feel myself falling…I’m feeling happy now
I feel myself falling…I’m feeling happy now
I feel myself falling…I’m feeling happy now
I feel myself falling…I’m feeling happy now, feeling happy now

I’m at the back of the club and so afraid to speak
Cos I’m not like these people and these people are not like me
Super heavy elements
Upgrade me
Supersonic elements
Amaze me
Your opinion is irrelevant
I was built to be magnificent

And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope
That there was no truth to what was wrote
Give me half as much but twice as fast or today
Might slip away

I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now
I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now
I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now
I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now, feeling happy now

I haven’t scratched the surface of my desire
In the world of dreams I’m a frequent flyer
Super heavy elements
Embrace me
Super heavy elements

I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now
I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now
I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now
I’m feeling immortal… we'll live forever now.

What about you and me?
We were supposed to play for keeps. Home grown from the streets,
The jungle in our reach
It ain't about bein' a hood
When you touch me like you should,
I'll rule every day
You let me in your world.

You see through of these years our love remains,
The moon will never let the tide go away
Through the pleasure and pain,
Through the sunshine and rain,

Baby, we keep on smilin'

Ravens fly across the moon
All in now, there's a noise in the sky
Following all the rules and not asking why

And when the sunset world begins

Drink all day cos the country's at war
You'll be falling on the palace floor
I can't be anymore than I say
In the flood you'll get washed away

When the sunset world begins
Turning into the night I see everything in black and white become
A love song for the collaboration you and me will never be undone
We'll let it flow away"

I've never been the same
I love my girl
Donna where, where can you be
Oh Donna, Oh Donna, Oh Donna, Oh Donna"
Rock,"Five days a week I'm just a-biding my time.
Fill in the hours till the weekend's mine.
All day long I've got my radio on.
Keeps me going till my work is done.

CHORUS:
Monday through to Friday.
Nothing goes my way.
Just working staying alive.
Monday.through to Sunday.
There's only one day.
Saturday is rock'n'roll time.

Work for the man just to get my pay.
Too many hours in the workig day.
Dead on my feet but I need the cash.
Roll on saturday make it fast.

CHORUS: repeated

I pay my dues to the union man.
Don't get too heavy.that's the way I am.
I live for rock'n'roll and Saturday night.
I hear the music and I feel alright.feel alright.

CHORUS: repeated"
Rock,"Sounds so great, everything you're saying
Do lies out loud change anything?
Go get mad
Have a child's tantrum
'Til everyone knows how wronged you've been

Look around, that's not me
Not one shred of who I'll be
You don't know what I do
The one way getting out is through

Damn, there's no practical advantage
To chase that love from the people hurting you
See all kinds, ones who think they need it
The ones who'll take it
Then, the ones who know the truth

Look around, that's not me
Not one shred of who I'll be
You don't know what I do
The one way getting out is through

Slow things down, baby check your motives
Sleep at night and stand up straight
Keep in mind, there's a big, big difference
Between letting go and running away

Look around, that's not me
Not one shred of who I'll be
You don't know what I do
The one way getting out is through"
Rock,"For 15 years Le Bin SonFought side by side with the Americans
In the mountains and deltas
of VietnamIn '75 Saigon fell and he left his command
And brought his family to the promised land
Seabrook, Texas and the small towns in the Gulf of Mexico
It was delta country and reminded him of home
He worked as a machinist, put his money away
And bought a shrimp boat with his cousin
And together they harvested Galveston Bay
In the mornin' 'fore the sun come up
He'd kiss his sleepin' daughter
Steer out thru thechannel
And cast his nets into the water
Billy Sutter fought with Charlie Company
In the highlands of Quang Tri
He was wounded in the battle of Chu Lai
Shipped home in '68
There he married and worked the gulf fishing grounds
In a boat that'd been his father's
In the morning he'd kiss his sleeping son
And cast his nets into the water
Billy sat in front of his TV as the South fell
And the communists rolled into Saigon
He and his friends watched as the refugees came
Settled on the same streets and worked the coast they'd grew up on
Soon in the bars around the harbor was talk
Of America for the Americans
Someone said 'You want 'em out, you got to burn 'em out.'
And brought in the Texas Klan
One humid Texas night there were 3 shadows on the harbor
Come to burn the Vietnamese into the sea
In the fire's light shots rang out
2 Texans lay dead on the ground
Le stood with a pistol in his hand
A jury acquitted him in self-defense
As before the judge he did stand
But as Le walked down the courthouse steps
Billy said 'My friend you're a dead man.'
One late summer night Le stood watch along the waterside
Billy stood in the shadows
His K-bar knife in his hand
And the moon slipped behind the clouds
Le lit a cigarette, the bay was still as glass
As he walked by Billy stuck his knife into his pocket
Took a breath and let him pass
In the early darkness Billy rose up
Went into the kitchen for a drink of water
Kissed his sleeping wife
Headed into the channel
And cast his nets into the water
Of Galveston Bay
"
Pop,"There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl
And God I know I'm one

My mother she's a tailor
She sews those new bluejeans
My father he's a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and trunk
And the only time he's ever satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

Oh mother tell your children
Not to do as I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl
And God I know I'm one"
Rock,"Got every reason to feel like I do
From the top of my head to the bottom of my shoes
'Cos last night my baby took the weight off my mind
Told me everything was gonna be fine

She said she loved me
I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me
'Cos she says every night, hold me tight, forever is right
Love is bright, moon delight, she's outa sight
Give me, give me, give me love your way

She could have resisted my efforts to pry
But she knows how I feel and she's not exactly shy
Though right now I'm lonely I know it won't be long
I can hear the train comin' bringin' lovin' along

She said she loved me
I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me
'Cos she says every night, hold me tight, forever is right
Love is bright, moon delight, she's outa sight
Give me, give me, give me love your way

Ooh I used to be so lost and confused
I stumbled through knowing that each door I tried
Was closed before me and knowing that I cried
But still I didn't rest I had to know
What was behind it all I'd come so far
And then I saw her note I couldn't believe she wrote

I couldn't resist it being beside her
Could have held that moment forever in my heart
The moment I saw her was the moment I knew
That her love is my life and her light's shining through

She said she loved me
I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me
'Cos she says every night, hold me tight, forever is right
Love is bright, moon delight, she's outa sight
Give me, give me, give me love your way

Ooh I used to be so lost and confused
I stumbled through knowing that each door I tried
Was closed before me and knowing that I cried
But still I didn't rest I had to know
What was behind it all I'd come so far
And then I saw her note I couldn't believe she wrote"
Pop,"You should have treated me right
But you left me lonely and cold at night.
Since you won't, someone will
Treat me better and be for real.

If you didn't want it you shoulda let me know
But since you didn't want it, then girl you got to go.
You left me sad and lonely, and ran away from home
So since I'm not your only, then go and fetch your bone.


Chrous:
Dawg, dirty dawg, dawg, dirty dawg,
Dawg, ooh, you're a dirty, dirty,
Dawg, dirty dawg, dawg, dirty dawg,
Dawg, oh, you're sow damn dirty.


I gave you all that I can
Til I caught you swingin'with another man
But this time you strayed too far
Now you come beggin' like the dog you are.

If you didn't want it you shoulda let me know
But since you didn't want it, then girl you got to go.
Don't think that you can play me, and jerk me all around.
You used to be ma baby, now your ass is in the pound.


Chorus:
Dawg, dirty dawg, dawg, dirty dawg,
Oohh, you're a drty, dirty,
Dawg, dirty dawg, dawg, dirty dawg
Oh, you're so damn dirty.


Yo, yo, why you wanna act like a tramp, a wet food stamp,
I think it's time for me to break camp
Had a crush on my man the first time we met.
Now what you see is what you get
Lost more than a mil on a gambling bet
So here's the Chuckwagon for the dog in you,
Here's the kennelration and the Alpo too

Now you know I didn't want her
She tried to back me on a corner told her
Blow the horn like little Jack Horner
Forever forbidden, the fast girls in life
The fast cars they call'em kittens
They've been known to amaze
But they can't pull one over me
I got game for days
Save the sap rap for the handicapped
I've been around the block and I didn't
Fall for the trimmed trap.


"
Pop,"I know Jesus loves me
In my heart I know it's true
I know Mary's little baby
Came into the world
Just to save me
But I don't know about you

My Gods a mighty big God
My God can shake the world up
Plagues and famines
Frogs and locusts
Walking on water
Burning bushes
Rolling the thunder
And parting the waters too

My God is good in the kitchen
Make a good meal from bread and fishes
Feed the hungry pour the wine
Everybodys welcome to have a good time
Sit at his table enjoy the food

I know Jesus loves me
He says I should love you
My neighbor not his wife
Don't covet steal kill or lie
My Gods got a lot of rules

My God made creation
Six days work one day vacation
Made a garden
Filled it with apples
Adam and Eve walked around natural
Until they are that one piece of bad fruit

I've heard that your Gods older
Buddha Allah Krishna
Manifest with many faces
Worshipped the world over in foreign places
I assume your God must love you

I know Jesus loves me
And my God is good and great and true
But if pride goeth before the fall
I hope someones God will save us all
Save us all
And love the sinners too"
Pop,"Seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first
And the truth comes second
Just stop, for a minute and
Smile

Why is everybody so serious
Acting so damn mysterious
You got your shades on your eyes
And your heels so high
That you can't even have a good
Time

Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that (yeah)
We're paying with love tonight

It's not about the money, money, money

Guarantee we'll be feelin

And you can keep the cars
Leave me the garage
And all I
Yes all I need are keys and guittars
And guess what, in 30 seconds I'm leaving to mars
Yes we leaving across these undefeatable odds
It's like this man, you can't put a price on my life
We do this for the love
So we fight and sacrifice every night
So we ain't gon stumble and fall never
Waiting to see, a sign of defeat uh uh
So we gon keep everyone moving their feet
So bring back the beat and then everyone sing

Pop,"And When I keep my heart under your tongue
You try to catch my breath and hold my tongue
You think you're so dreamy, can't survive without your touch
But if you must know, I don't miss you much
You think you're so special when you lie
Turning tears to crystal when you cry
I think you should go back to your shallow little life
So I can finally breathe and say goodbye

You know, even though you think you're perfect
Having you around just ain't worth it
Cause & effect, babe, that's love
See me, I'm the one that's making you pay
For all of your stupid mistakes
Cause & effect, babe, that's love

I don't feel like dealing with your mess
It's an unnecessary bout of stress
I believe in karma and in peaceful harmony
So get your shady heart away from me

You know, even though you think you're perfect
Having you around just ain't worth it
Cause & effect, babe, that's love
See me, I'm the one that's making you pay
For all of your stupid mistakes
Cause & effect, babe, that's love

And in this game now we're tasting the truth
You always win but baby, this time you lose"
Pop,"I don't care, if you're here
Or if you're not alone
I don't care, it's been too long
It's kinda like we didn't happen
The way that your lips move
The way you whisper so
I don't care, it's good, it's gone (Uh)

I said I won't lose control, I don't want it (Ooh)
I said I won't get too close but I can't stop it

Oh, no, there you go, you're making me a liar
Got me begging you for more
Oh, no, there I go
Startin' up a fire, oh, no, no (Oh, no)
Oh, no, there you go
You're making me a liar, I kinda like it though
Oh, no, there I go
Startin' up a fire, oh, no, no (Ooh)

You're watching, I feel it (Hey)
I know I shouldn't stare (Yeah, yeah)
I picture your hands on me
I think I wanna let it happen
But what if you kiss me? (Yeah)
And what if I like it?
And no one sees it

I said I won't lose control, I don't want it
I said I won't get too close but I can't stop it (No)

Oh, no, there you go, you're making me a liar

Don't go, no, no, no
Startin' up a fire
I don't believe myself when I say
That I don't need you, oh
I don't believe myself when I say
So, don't believe me

Oh, no, no, no
Startin' up a fire"
Pop,"If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
If you could feel my heartbeat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer

I don't admit it, I play it cool
Every minute that I'm with you
I feel the fever and I won't lie, I break a sweat
My body's telling all the secrets
I ain't told you yet

Oh oh, I struggle to contain
The love that's in my veins
And how it circulates

If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
If you could feel my heartbeat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer

You've taken over the beat of my body
You just don't let up, don't let up
You've taken over the beat of my body
But you lift me up, lift me up

If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
If you could feel my heartbeat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer

So close together, so far apart
You're turning me on
And my body's waiting for your spark

Oh oh, I struggle to contain
The love that's in my veins
And how it circulates

If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
If you could feel my heartbeat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer

You've taken over the beat of my body
You just don't let up, don't let up
You've taken over the beat of my body
But you lift me up, lift me up

If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
If you could feel my heartbeat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer

The truth is out, no stopping now
I'm getting closer
I've had enough, undressed my love
I'm coming over

If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
If you take my pulse

You've taken over the beat of my body
You just don't let up, don't let up
You've taken over the beat of my body
But you lift me up, lift me up

If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
If you could feel my heartbeat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer"
Pop,"Dead roses on Valentine's
Rumours lying on grape vines
Your love washes over me like cheap red wine
But you feel on your lows
And they leave me dry
I live on a broken heart
Scream and, boy, you shout me first
Your blood washes over me like cheap red wine
Your words are like bullets, leave me to die

When you don't love me
When you don't need me
When you don't want me
Darlin', it's time
When you don't love me
When you don't need me
When you don't want me
Darlin', it's time

Won't stay when I'm not welcomed
Swarms in and I have been stung
Your love washes over me like gin and lime
Your words are so cold
Leave me with frostbite
Do I need truth or healing? (Get up)
Down your neck, I'm breathing (Get up)
I need to feel needed (Get up)
This doesn't justify, yeah

When you don't love me
(When you don't love me)
When you don't need me
(When you don't need me)
When you don't want me

Pop,"I've tried playing it cool
But when I'm looking at you
I can't ever be brave
'Cause you make my heart race

Shot me out of the sky
You're my kryptonite
You keep making me weak
Yeah, frozen and can't breathe

Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing

Now I'm climbing the walls
But you don't notice at all
That I'm going out of my mind
All day and all night

Something's gotta give now
Cause I'm dying just to know your name
And I need you here with me now
Cause you've got that one thing

So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing

So get out, get out, get out of my mind
And come on, come into my life

Pop,"The journey has been long
A thousand memories strong
Faced with the night
Not caring who is right
Looking for the laughter that's been gone

How did we used to touch
Why do we think so much
We tire of the words of reflection
And long for affection
For the lovers' rush

Now that we're here after all of these years
Love is calling

Now that we're here so far and so near
Love is calling

Time and again we've trid

To let our feelings slide
Endless negotiations
And unmet expectations
Let's set it all aside

Now that we're here and our motives are clear
Love is calling

Now that we're here--plaintive, sincere
Love is calling

I have been lying still
I have been lying still
Dreaming of the truth

The journey has been long
The candor made us strong
Holding you tonight
In this familiar light
Can we take this sweetness to the dawn

Now that we're here and the walls disappear
Love is calling

Now that we're here and there's no one to fear
Love is calling

Now that we're here after all of the tears
Love is calling
Now that we're here--we're finally here
Love is calling

I have been lying still
I have been lying still
Dreaming of the truth

The journey has been long
The candor made us strong
Holding you tonight
In this familiar light
Can we take this sweetness to the dawn

Now that we're here
And the walls disappear
Love is calling
Now that we're here
And there's no one to fear
Love is calling"
Pop,"Long gone

Lips move, I can not hear
A single word, they're trying to say
A car crash, in front of me
But I'm not there, I'm everywhere, there

I shut my ears, a long time ago
More comfortable, an' less vulnerable
I may o' miss a beat, be it so
'Cause I hear my soul when I'm

[Chorus]
Long gone
I'm not coming in today
I'm
Long gone
(Gone gone long)
Long gone
Next time
I come around
I promise
I won't let you down
But now
I'm long gone

I'm calling in sick today

Life's a sentence without tense
I'm hungry, give me some
Nothing never ever taste the same
No
Nothing ever changes
An' heaven knows that we've got hell to pay
I'll deal with that another day, 'cause now I'm

[Chorus (x1) ]

Long gone
Long gone
Tears in the sky, but I'm flyin' higher
I'm long gone

Material's bordering on translucence
Perhaps to you it makes no sense
But I'm still Ok to go
Inside of me the weather's beautiful, oh sandman

[Chorus (x1) ]

Long gone
(Gone gone long)
Long gone
Next time
I come around
I promise
I will bring you some, 'til then

Pop,"(Robb Boldt / Howie Hersh / Iki Levy / Paula Abdul / Da' Count / Eric Monsanty / Cha'n Andre)

It all went down at the cantina that she liked
Everyone would watch her as she danced all through the lights
She was the center of attraction in him mind
Maria thought she'd never find a man worth her time
Oooo he came into the room
Oooo she really liked the way that he began to move
They were in the mood for romancin'
There's a fire in little Havana
Flame so hot you can't stand it
Things are getting a little crazy
Someone better tell them that

Chorus:
Love don't come that easy
(I know you're ready boy)
We've got to control all emotions that we're feeling
Love don't come that easy
We've gotta be strong
Swing
We've gotta stay strong
Straight

As he took her in his arms
She got an instant chill
A sense of passion
She thought no one could make her feel
Their bodies moved with such intensity
The lights went down
Made sighs of pleasure
Like there was no one else around
Ooh now she's in the mood
Ooh to show him what she wants to do
She's got him crazy
There's a fire in little Havana
Flame so hot you can't stand it
Things are getting a little crazy
Can you feel it
(Yeah)
Are you ready
(Yeah)

Pop,"Think I don't need a watch to tell the time
Think I don't need the sun to help me shine
Think I don't need a girl to be alright
Guess I didn't know

Thought I didn't need shoes on my feet
Thought I didn't need a bed to fall asleep
Thought I didn't need love to be complete
Guess I didn't know

That I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me, for me

You're all I think about when I'm awake
Part of every night and every day
And everything's a mess when you're away
Now I know

All of this is good and really old
I'm having trouble sleeping on my own
Feeling like a house but not a home
I want you to know

That I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me, for me

Guess I need a watch to tell the time
Guess I need the sun to help me shine
And I really need you in my life
Now I know

That you give me this crazy feeling
And you won't have to wait no more for me, for me
And I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me"
Pop,"I see the B-boys, Break it down girl,
I see you brushing them off of your shoulder,
I can feel it, Getting louder,
Can't keep our feet on the ground for much longer,
They wanna close, The lights come up,
But no way, So follow me,
And we can hit the runway
Break it down now,
Shake the ground now,
Wanna hear you scream loud with the countdown, (5)

Out of sight,
Say goodbye and we disappear,
Let's take off tonight,
Going in so hard that the world can't take us,
Can't take us, Can't take us,
Gone from the atmosphere
The heat is rising, Getting louder,
All the ladies look like a damn poster,
Grab your girlfriend, Pull her closer,
Make her ride it, ride it, Roller coaster,
They can try to shut this down, But no way,
We're taking off, It's time to clear the runway
Break it down now,
Shake the ground now,

Can't take us, Can't take us,
Gone from the atmosphere"
Pop,"[do do do]
Jive talkin'
For tellin' me lies
Jive talkin'
You wear a disguise
Jive talkin'
So misunderstood [yeah]
Jive talkin'
You're really no good
[dododododododo do do do x4]

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb

How deep is your love how deep is your love
I really need to love
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
And they should all just let us be
We belong to you and me
[do do do do]
How deep is your love
[do do do do]
How deep is your
[do do do do]
How deep is your love
[do do do do]
How deep is your love

Well you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man
No time to talk
Music loud and my feelin's warm
I can do you right since I was born
And now it's all right that's okay
you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a mother or whether you're a brother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
People stayin' alive stayin' alive
Ah ah ah ah stayin' alive stayin' alive
Ah ah ah ah stayin' alive [yeah]
I'm stayin' alive
"
Pop,"I've finally gone and told you, this act of ours is over
A future torn apart
And if you asked me, a year ago where I'd be
Without you there beside me
I wouldn't know where to start

I should be crying
Head in my hands and hiding
Or fired up like lightning
But I don't feel a thing
I should be broken
From all these words unspoken
Now it's all unfolding
I don't feel a thing

Does my blood run cold?
Is my heart made of stone?
Is this all too much to let it go?
Oh no, I'm not scared
Won't let these eyes see red
Is this the end of everything I know?

If its the end of everything
Why don't I feel afraid?

Lately, been thinking how you shaped me
Believing I was crazy
For never losing faith
Now I question, was it really your intention
Were you wasting my potential
To keep me in my place

I should be crying
Head in my hands and hiding
Or fired up like lightning
But I don't feel a thing
I should be broken
From all these words unspoken
Now it's all unfolding
I don't feel a thing

Does my blood run cold?
Is my heart made of stone?
Is this all too much to let it go?
Oh no, I'm not scared
Won't let these eyes see red
Is this the end of everything I know?

If its the end of everything
Why don't I feel afraid?

Does my blood run cold?
Is my heart made of stone?
Is this all too much to let it go?
Oh no, I'm not scared
Won't let these eyes see red
Is this the end of everything I know?

If its the end of everything
Why don't I feel afraid?"
Pop,"(Whoa... Whoa...)

Yo, check out our latest thing 4x

Baby girl, here she ain't no amateur (ah)
Wears couture and smiles for the camera (hey)
Hottest bags, got the meanest handler
Yes, she is the hottest thing
When I'm out and takin' trips,
I mean, there she goes up in my mix
From Paris, Peru, to every club
(She be tearin' it up, what)

She is so sexy and I'm into her
Yeah, I'm into her, for sure...
She go on like a circus,
The way she works it, work it, work it
Straight up, like a circus
The way she works it, works it, works it

Bridge:
(Baby, go and work it)
Do you like my body? (Girl, you know I do)
Do you think that I'm a hottie? (Girl, you know I do)
Do you wanna go and party? (Girl, you know I do)
Well, what do you want to do? (Here's what I wanna do)


Chorus:
I'm-a give you some grown man (hey)
I'm-a give you some grown man (oh)
I'm-a give you some grown man
Baby, show me what you gonna do

Boy, she's livin' the crazy life
The day don't start until the midnight
Don't need the sign, she's got control
Workin' in slow motion
She stands on bars and pops on tables,
Showin' her designer labels
I ask her why she's so unstable,
(She's just lucky, but don't call her easy)

She is so sexy and I'm into her
Yeah, I'm into her, for sure...
She go on like a circus,
The way she works it, work it, work it
Straight up, like a circus
The way she works it, works it, works it

So, you wanna get with me?
I gotta say that's water
But I must admit I ain't easy
You're gonna be workin' over time on me
Hey, hey, hey, hey... Tell me what you want

Yo, check out our latest thing 4x"
Pop,"We're a thousand miles from comfort
We have traveled land and sea
But as long as you are with me
There's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever, exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you
My heart continues to beat

With every step we take
Tokyo to the bay strolling so casusally
We're different and the same
Get you another name
Switch up the batteries

If you gave me, a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll we make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shake me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
No no no no no, no place I'd rather be
No no no no no, no place I'd rather be
No no no no no, no place I'd rather be

We staked out on a mission
To find our inner peace
Make ir everlasting, so nothing's incomplete
It's easy being with you, sacred simplicity
As long as we're together
There's no place I'd rather be

With every step we take
Tokyo to the bay strolling so casusally
We're different and the same
Get you another name
Switch up the batteries

If you gave me, a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll we make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shake me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
No no no no no, no place I'd rather be
No no no no no, no place I'd rather be
No no no no no, no place I'd rather be
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be"
Pop,"I'll be alright
I'm a man with his mind in motion
I'll be alright
I've got the will to live
I'll be alright
I'm a man with his mind in motion
I'm gonna give it all I've got to give

What's happening
Yeah me too
Just can't seem to shake those ordinary blues
One thing I can tell you
Hold your spirit tight
Something's on the move
It's gonna be alright

On the way down to paradise
I kept stepping on my wings
The tears, the time, the trouble
I had to take a stand
I found my way to land
I'm gonna be alright

Sometimes I think I live by miracles alone
Click those ruby slippers and hope to be back home
Say just where I'll find you
And that's just where I'll be
Building me an igloo by the sea"
Pop,"Twinkle twinkle super star, fame and fortune took you far
Everybody envies you, you're number one
Night and day your records play, but ever since she went away
Life ain't no fun
The songs you write about her, keep coming back without her
The king of the charts is the king of broken hearts

Chorus
Number one with a heart ache
Hear the man singing on the radio
With every play his heart is breaking
Number one with a heart ache
Sing your song while the whole world sings along
Your love is gone, but the music goes on

Gee it was a long hard climb, and it took a lot of time
Time away from her when you should've been there
Birthdays on the telephone, Christmases she spent alone
I wasn't fair
It took so long to make it, the girl just couldn't take it
Now that it's made was it worth the price you paid

Number one with a heart ache
Hear the man singing on the radio
With every play his heart is breaking
Number one with a heart ache
Sing your song while the whole world sings along
Your love is gone, but the music goes on

Number one with a heart ache
Hear the man singing on the radio
With every play his heart is breaking
Number one with a heart ache
Sing your song while the whole world sings along
Your love is gone, but the music goes on

the boys come and now i'm close to tears
i cant let go of you now
imaginations playin' out for free
in my world i take him out for tea
oh my god he can't say no
skippin' school gone walk for air
i just had to get out of there
i'm on overload in my head
train comes i don't know its destination
its a one way ticket to a madman situation
train comes i don't know it's destination
its a one way ticket to a madman situation
life in a dream time does come true
and in my sleep i think of you
feather bed by myself
basically probability
says a face gone side with me
it's been so long on my shelf
train comes i don't know its destination
its a one way ticket to a mad man situation
train comes i don't know its destination
its a one way ticket to a mad man situation
the tension is incredible
boy i'm in charge
you know how i feel for you
when you stop or when you just keep going
please don't say no no no

Pop,"I stare at my reflection in the mirror
Why am I doing this to myself
Losing my mind on a tiny error
I nearly left the real me on the shelf
No, no, no, no

Don't lose who you are, in the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard
to follow your heart
But tears don't mean you're losing
everybody's bruising
Just be true with who you are

(Who you are, who you are, who you are x4)

Brushing my hair, do I look perfect?
I forgot what to do to fit the mold
The more I try, the less it's working
Cause everything inside me screams: no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Don't lose who you are in the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard to follow your heart
But tears don't mean you're losing
everybody's bruising
There's nothing wrong with who you are

Yes, Nos, egos
fake shows like WOO
Just go, and leave me alone
Real talk, real life, good luck, good night
With a smile...
That's my home, yeah
That is my home...

No, no, no, no, no...
Don't lose who you are, in the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard to follow your heart
But tears don't mean you're losing
everybody's bruising"

Through the carnage of the crash
[Baby I'm with you]
And the photos in a flash
[Baby I'm with you]
Through violent seas
[Baby I'm with you]
Until release
[Baby I'm with you]

And all the animals in the park
Are waiting for their dinner to come
And all the creatures in the dark
Are waiting for the light to come on

We are the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien
God loves the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien
All the animals in the park, alien
And all the strangers that wake up in the dark
Are waiting for the light to come on

Through electronic desire
[Baby I'm with you]
And the elements of fire
[Baby I'mwith you]
Through everything

All the counterfeited scream tonight
When all the elevated
Become illuminated

We are the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien
God loves the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien

Pop,"(Arnold Hennins / Debra Killings)

Lately I've had my doubts
About the way you feel
Tell me there is no other love
You see but me, ooooh
I've been a good woman to you
Give you my sweet love every night
Break up, make up
That's all that we do
So if you better want me love
You've got to go down

Chorus:
The choice is yours
The choice is yours
The choice is yours if you can find something better
The choice is yours
The choice is yours
Just like it seems you know it really don't matter

Don't be a fool and take too long
To make your move
A woman like me deserves a knight
In armor too
I've been a good woman to you
Give you sweet love every night
Break up, make up
That's all that we do
So if you better want me love
You've got to go down

Chorus

I never give in to friends
That don't give in to me
Treat me with love
Desire to be with only me

"
Pop,"Paint me a picture
Show me your colors
I'm gone when I'm with you
But I'm better than ever
I breathe you in
You breathe me out
You just take it all away
You're acid rain in an endless drought
But you make it all okay
Take me to your place
You set me on fire
You tell me it's okay
While you burn me alive
I breathe you in
You breathe me out
You just take it all away
You're acid rain in an endless drought
But you make it all okay
You tell me that you want me
But we both know that's not true
Cause you're a beautiful disaster
And I'll never be good enough for you
Think you're addicted to the chase
Think I'm addicted to the pain
I breathe you in
You breathe me out
And you play me like a game
You're in my veins
Can't get you out
I'm addicted to the pain
Cause you don't have a piece of me
You've got all of me
And you're never gonna change
I let you in
You let me down
Cause you're never gonna stay
You are never gonna stay
No you're never gonna stay
You are never gonna stay
You were never gonna stay"
Pop,"Miss mississippi, I ain't no pageant queen
I'm more like bob wire in bear feet
In a pair of cut off jeans
My baby drives a new pick up
He's got a ten inch lift
He takes me muddin' through back roads
And he lets me shift

If you wanna get me figured out
You better pack it up and take a little trip down south
There's a whole other different side of me
Miss mississippi
My momma shops at the walmart
My daddy dips kodiak
Got two big dogs on the front porch
And some fake dear targets out back

If you wanna get me figured out
You better pack it up and take a little drip down south
There's a whole other different side of me
Miss mississippi
Green grass and blue skies
Moonshines and dandelions
River banks and water tanks
I love you's and spray paint

If you wanna get me figured out
You better pack it up and take a little trip down south

There's a whole other different side of me

I never win when I
Keep all my thoughts inside

Everything will be alright
I know I haven't seen you lately
But you're always on my mind""

I don't know what

Ahead of you

Pop,"At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song

At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I could call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never, never known

Oh, you smiled
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine
At last

You are mine
At last
You are mine
At last

Pop,"They throwed him in jail
And they kept him there
Hoping so he'd die
That his body and spirit would waste away
And soon after that his mind

But every day is born a fool
One who thinks that he can rule
One who says tomorrow's mine
One who wakes one day to find

The prison doors open the shackles broken
And chaos in the street
Everybody sing we're free free free free
Everybody sing we're free free free free
Everybody sing we're free free free free

They throwed him in jail
And they kept him there
Hoping his memory'd die
That the people forget how he once led
And fought for justice in their lives

But every day is born a man
Who hates what he can't understand
Who thinks the answer is to kill
Who thinks his actions are god's will

And he thinks he's free free free free
Yes he thinks he's free free free free
He thinks he's free free free free

Soon must come the day
When the righteous have their way
Unjustly tried are free
And people live in peace I say
Give the man release
Go on and set your conscience free
Right the wrongs you made
Even a fool can have his day

Let us all be free free free free
Let us all be free free free free
Let us all be free free free free

Free our bodies free our minds
Free our hearts
Freedom for everyone
And freedom now
Freedom now
Freedom now
Freedom now

Let us all be free free free free
Let us all be free free free free"

This is it I'm about to flip
You're staying But I wish you were leaving

I'll never be your wife
I feel just like deadly
You're turning psycho on me

Whoa baby
no baby
don't wanna know baby

You're turining psycho on me

You call my house
you ask my friends
you wanna know how I'm doing
Real cute stuff but I call the bluff
You bitter you don't think I know it
So whip the tears out of your eyes
The guilt trip thing isn't working
get your tounge out of my mouth
It's more then just a little disturbing

You're P-S-Y-C-H-O
I thought that you ought to know
why can't you just let me be

You better rethink your life
I'll never be your wife

Pop,"So many times you promised me,
you promised that you'd write.
And so much time has passed
but I can't face that fact tonight.

My friends all ask the question,
I don't know what to say.
I'm haunted everywhere I go
by the mention of your name.

Chorus:
I've been so frustrated,
my heart's devestated,
and yet fascinated...
I'm so much in love with you!

I'm so in love, so much in love,
I'm still in love with you.
Somehow you played me,
you lied and betrayed me--
yet I'm in love with you.

All those nights of romance,
wrapped in your embrace.
Tenderly you learned my secrets
and all their state of grace.

Hopelessly I fell hard,
helplessly I cried.
When finally I heard the rumors
that couldn't be denied.

Chorus

I close my eyes, I see your face,
I feel your touch, it only gets worse,
and I try to forget, I try to forget...

Chorus (untill fade)

Pop,"Let me use your toothbrush
Have you got a clean shirt?
My panties in a wad
At the bottom of my purse
I walk into the street
The air's so cool
I'm wired and I'm tired
And I'm grinnin' like a fool

I've been on the floor lookin' for a chair
I've been on a chair lookin' for a couch
And I've been on a couch lookin' for a bed...
Lookin' for a bed
Lookin' for my, my...

My right hand, my right hand man (repeat 4x)
Say... my right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man

If he can't fix it, I don't know who can

The sinsemilla? salesman
And the cops on the block
They know what I been doin'
They see the way I walk
I wonder what they see now
I wonder what they do
To feel somebody want them
The way I'm wanting you

I've been on the floor lookin' for a chair
I've been on a chair lookin' for a couch
And I've been on a couch lookin' for a bed...
Lookin' for a bed
Lookin' for... to really be...

My right hand, my right hand man (repeat 4x)
Say... my right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man

Use me up if you think you can

I've been on the floor lookin' for a chair
I've been on a chair lookin' for a couch
And I've been on a couch lookin' for a bed...
Lookin' for a bed
Lookin' for my...

Beauty from the East, beautiful sisters on the beach
Beast, beauty from the streets

Pop,"Every night in my window
I see pictures of the day we met
I keep wishing on the falling stars
To forget you but it hasn't happened yet

And I still remember when you walked away
It was more than my heart could believe
Careless wind blew the smell of your perfume away
But the touch of you
It never leaves


So I'll never stop believing
Someday your love is coming back to me
No I'll never stop believing
Someday that you'll be coming back to me


Everybody in my life
They say forget that girl
She's gone for good
How can I explain this heart
It just keeps hanging on
Cause something says it should


Oh I go on remembering how good we were
The sweetest days I'll ever know
This careless boy
Somehow he let you get away
But the touch of you
He'll never let it go


Time and time again I see
Just how much she meant to me
Oh a love like that is meant to be
She's got to come back
She's got to come back

"
Pop,"Good evening ladies
This is your captain speaking
Were about to atempt a crashlanding
Were going down"
Pop,"There’s times when fake goodbyes made you cry
But this time you don’t
And I was only joking I was broken when you told me to go
Don’t make up the wrong mind
Don’t forget the good times
Let me stay a little longer cause if I’m gone-
I can’t make it right
In just one night we could go back in time maybe
Go back and find where we both went wrong
It won’t take long I know
Don’t let me go
Oh don’t let me go
I’m not giving up I’m still in love, is all I need you to say
And I don’t need an answer just a chanceto
make the pain go away
So don’t make up the wrong mind
Don’t forget the good times
Let me stay a little longer cause if I’m gone-
I can’t make it right...
I beg you to find what it takes to forgive meof
all my mistakes
Cause if I walk out of your life
There’ll be no way back this time
Don’t let me go
Don’t make up the wrong mind
Don’t forget the good times
Stay a little longer cause if I’m gone-
I can’t make it right
In just one night we could go back in time maybe
Go back and find where we both went wrong
It won’t take long I know
Don’t let me go
Oh don’t let me go."
Pop,"Sugar sweet, if only they all knew
Jam, can't spread no more you've took my bread

Me, myself I'd rather be alone again

So you can do what you like -Do what you like
No need to ask me -Do what you want
Do what you like -Do what you like
No need to tell me -Do what you want

Ice, could never be as cold as you

Pop,"Love is such a precious gift
One thing in my life I know is true
And I.O.U.
Deeper than the ocean
You touch me like no one could ever do
I.O.U.

CHORUS:
And I never could repay the look that's in your eyes
I could save up all my kisses till the end of time
All my love in my life 'til it's through, I.O.U

Love is such a precious gift
The currency of life I never knew
Now I.O.U.
Keep it for eternity
The vow I made the day I said ""I do""
I.O.U.

And I never could repay the look that's in your eyes
So to pledge myself to you would be no sacrifice
All my love in my life 'til it's through, I.O.U.

You lay me down on hallowed ground with one touch of your hand
You hold me like a baby, that's when suddenly I understand
All that you do, I owe it to you

All my love in my life 'til it's true, I .O.U. (X2)

And I never could repay the look that's in your eyes
I could save up all the kisses 'til the end of time
So to pledge myself to you would be no sacrifice
All my love in my life 'til it's true, I.O.U."
Pop,"She's staring at me
I'm sitting wondering what she's thinking
Nobody's talking
Cause talking just turns into screaming

And now is I'm yelling over her
She's yelling over me
All that means
Is neither of us is listening

(And what's even worse)
That we don't even remember
Why were fighting

So both of us are mad for
Nothing
(Fighting for) Nothing
(Crying for) Nothing

But we won't let it go for
Nothing
(No not for) Nothing

This should be nothing
To a love like what we got

Oh, baby, I know sometimes
It's gonna rain
But baby, can we make up now
Cause I can't sleep through the pain
(Cant sleep through the pain)

Girl, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed
(Mad at me)

No, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed
(Mad at me)

And it gets me upset
Girl, when you're constantly accusing
(Asking questions
Like you've already known)

We're fighting this war, baby
When both of us are losing
(This ain't the way
That love is supposed to go)

(What happened to working it out)

We've felled into this place
Where you ain't backing down
And I ain't backing down
So what the hell do we do now

It's all for
Nothing
(Fighting for) Nothing
(Crying for) Nothing

But we won't let it go
For nothing
(No not for) Nothing

This should be nothing
To a love like what we got

Oh, baby, I know sometimes
It's gonna rain (It's gonna rain)
But baby, can we make up now
Cause I can't sleep through the pain
(Cant sleep through the pain)

Girl, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed
(Mad at me)

No, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed
(Mad at me)

Oh, baby, this love couldn't be perfect
(Perfect, oh, no)
And just how good it's gonna be

We can't fuss, and we can't fight
Long as everything all right between us
Before we go to sleep

Baby, we're gonna be? happy

Baby, I know sometimes
It's gonna rain
But baby, can we make up now
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain
(Can?t sleep through the pain)

Girl, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed

No, I don't wanna go to bed

And I don't want you to go to bed

Pop,"I'm mad at you, because af all the things you do
I want you to see the way your games are hurting me
So why did I ever fall in love with you
You're all of my nightmares and dreams come true

What can I do to make you talk this problem through
You said you've nothing to hide
So let me hear your feelings inside
I never dreamed that I'd see this kind of thing in my life
So baby, plase let me go, let me go

Whatever you do to me
Somebody else will do to you
However you break my heart
Somebody else will break yours too

All I can see are staring eyes of mistery
I've tried to look behind before you take my dignity and pride
We sit and talk all night, still you never seem to lose your height
You believe in yourself, I hope I'm never gonna need your help

Whatever you do to me
Somebody else will do to you
However you break my heart
Somebody else will break yours too

You don't want me, you don't need me, I got news now
Cos baby I'm watching you

Whatever you do to me
Somebody else will do to you
However you break my heart
Somebody else will break yours too
"
Pop,"It will tear you up, it will break you down
It will spin your head 'round and 'round
Like a midnight thief in disguise
It will steal your soul right before your eyes

It will make you lose sleep
When you're in deep, oh yes it will
It will fool with a taste
But it's bittersweet like a candy coated pill

I said woah oh oh oh
Better keep running
Better keep running
Woah oh oh oh
Take it from me when I say
Woah oh oh oh
Better keep running
Better keep running

Yeah
Our love's start coming
Better keep running
No

I've done the dance, I've paid the price
It cost me my heart, it cost me my pride

It will make you lose sleep
When you're in deep, oh yes it will
It will fool with a taste
But it's bittersweet like a candy coated pill

I said wah oh oh oh
Better keep running
Better keep running
Woah oh oh oh
Take it from me when I say
Woah oh oh oh
Better keep running
Better keep running

Yeah
Our love's start coming
You better keep running

You better keep
Better keep
Better keep, keep running
Better keep
You better keep
Better keep, keep running
You better keep
Better keep
Better keep, keep running

Cause I said woah oh oh oh (woah oh)
Better keep running
Better keep running
Woah oh oh oh (oh oh no)
Take it from me when I say
Woah oh oh oh
Better keep running
Better keep running

Yeah
Our love's start coming
You better keep running
When love's start coming
Oh, you better keep running

Chorus:
Rock you house you
Turn the fire up takin' over
Rock you house you
People get strong
Rock you house you
Time to take the weight
Off your shoulder
Rock you house you
People move on

And yes it's time to grow
Spent enough time to know
To believe in you is blind
You only tell us lies
So now that we've agreed
It's time to end your greed
The unanimous decision
Is to rock you

Chorus

You shake a million hands
Make a million plans
The give a promise
To the poor
And millions a war
We tried to beg and plead
Still you ignore our needs
So the only way to teach you
Is to rock you

When I think about the
Babies' eyes
Longing from hunger
It makes me wanna
Cry, cry cry
Then the situation
Of our mothers
And our brothers
Well I know, I know
We can make it better.

To the nations telling lies
To the brothers
Down the block
To the power on the street
To the critics on my jock
Shut up and dance!!

Who can rain and chase the dust away
Everybody wants to shine
Ooh, come out on a cloudy day
'Til the sun that loves you proud
When the system tries to bring you down
Every hand to shine tonight
You don't need darkness to do what you think is right

Everybody is a star
I can feel it when you shine on me
I love you for who you are
Not the one you feel you need to be
Ever catch a falling star
Ain't no stopping 'til it's in the ground
Everybody is a star
One big circle going round and round

Forever
Be my valentine girl

Although we only just met
You're everything to me

Producing everything for everything to be replaced
And indirty towns we will settle down
Manufacture for the human race

The greatest story that was ever told in the lights of history
Was the grand designs of other men
And they built those walls for you and me
So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
Cos idle hands make idle men
Don't start thinking with your heart again
Cos idle hands make idle men

When the work is done, the work is done
We'll bebionic and beyond the circuits of our minds
We'll get nothing done under electric sun
Leave the weight of labour far behind

We're the greatest story that was ever told
But we don't know where we're from
And the walls became but a memory
Of the days when all the work begun

So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
Cos idle hands make idle men

Rejoice the day, the day the work is done
Rejoice the day, the day the work is done
Everybody's counting hours
Everybody's counting hours
'Til the day the work is done
'Til the day the work is done

So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
Cos idle hands make idle men
So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
Cos idle hands make idle men

Rejoice the day, the day the work is done
Rejoice the day, the day the work is done
Everybody's counting hours
Everybody's counting hours."
Pop,"Sorry
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like sorry like sorry

Forgive me
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like forgive me forgive me

But you can say baby
Baby can I hold you tonight
maybe if I'd told you the right words
At the right time you'd be mine

I love you
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like I love you I love you

But you can say baby
Baby can I hold you tonight
Maybe if I'd told you the right words
at the right time you'd be mine

Baby can I hold you tonight
Maybe if I'd told you the right words
at the right time you'd be mine
You'd be mine
You'd be mine...."

Pop,"What am I to you and what are you to me?
Are we getting better or did we used to be?
What of the song we used to sing?
Where are the souls we used to carry in?
What is a sail without hurricane?
What is a hurt without someone to blame?
Show me the sky and I'll climb the stairs
Give me something 'cause I'm losing it.

Give me what it is you believe in
'Cause I give to you my truth
I got all my faith in you
I don't know which way we are going
Doesn't matter anyway
Just as long as you will stay.

Tell me the word and I'll shout it out
For what is a voice when in doubt?
The world has changed
The world will change
Oh give me something cause I need to feel.

It's so good you know
I still love you so
And you don't have to do this on your own.
No, no"
Pop,"Too low
Turn it up some more
Too chill
To get us on the floor

Hot jam
Where's the volume at
Make it loud
Loud as it can get

You say
Bump up the groove
You say
808
Makes you move

So big
Walls start to shake
Come on
You like
All you can take

You say you wannna get a little bump in here
Shaking the room, give it the boom
Cmon
You say you wanna get a little bump in here
It's all good
You gotta listen when the girls say
Everybody get a little bump in here
Level to ten, bump it again
Cmon
Say you wannna get a little bump in here
It's all good
You gotta listen when the boys say

Phatt beat
Like to feel the drops
Dj
Never gonna stop

The heat is on
Turn it up some more
I know
What you're waiting for

You say
Bump up the jam
Push it
Loud as you can

So big
House starts to shake
Volume
Walls start to break

You say you wannna get a little bump in here
Shaking the room, give it the boom
Cmon
You say you wanna get a little bump in here
It's all good
You gotta listen when the girls say
Everybody get a little bump in here
Level to ten, bump it again
Cmon
Say you wannna get a little bump in here
It's all good
You gotta listen when the boys say

Bump it in the big ride...gotta get the party on
Ready for the good time...we'll be jammin all night long
Even in the head phones...gotta get it loud enough
Never keep it too low...put it on the big ones and pump it up

[Chorus]"
Pop,"She sees them out on the street in the mornin'
The hard legs in the slim headwalk
When they look down, there's no blood in the water
And people listen to them when they talk

She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?

She'd like to get something off her chest
She knows that time isn't on her side
They told her she gets to have it all
A pretty story but she knows they lied, lied

She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?

Just as the ghost of Miss Monroe
Be the best in the world and have nothin' to show
Be a meal for the wolves or a rich man's prize
Peak around that door, see their hunger in their eyes
Well, it comes as no surprise

And when she's lookin' good, so good, mighty good
She feels a target on her back
And if she doesn't try to soothe your ego
She stands accused of a mood so black, so black

She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
She'd much rather be a boy, dontcha know?
Oh yes, she'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
Well, she'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
Oh, she'd much rather be a boy, dontcha know
Dontcha know, dontcha know?

(Boy, dontcha know
Boy, dontcha know
Boy, dontcha know
Boy, dontcha know)

Well, she'd rather be a
She'd rather, she'd rather
She'd rather, she'd rather
She'd rather be a little boy, dontcha know?
She'd rather, she'd rather
She'd rather, she'd rather
Boy, dontcha know?"
Pop,"Unsettled hearts
Promise what they can't deliver
Bring me the wine
And the cold night air to clear my head
Gray matter memory house
Master of this trembling flesh
Steady still my doubts
Let me speak the word that precedes bliss
Let me speak the word
Let me speak the word

Love love love love love love love love

Let me speak the word
Let me speak the word

Love love love love love love love love

Let me speak the word
Let me speak the word

Let me speak the word
Let me speak the word

These weakened knees
Have not touched ground or pew in ages
I haven't bowed my head
To offer thanks to any god or to ask for favors
But watch me now
I'm falling down
Praying
To speak the word that precedes bliss
To speak the word
To speak the word

Love love love love love love love love

Let me speak the word
Let me speak the word

Love love love love love love love love

Let me speak the word
Let me speak the word

Let me speak the word
Let me speak the word"
Pop,"Santa baby,just slip a sable under the tree for me
Been an awful good girl
Santa baby,so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby,a 54 convertible too,light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby,so hurry down the chimney tonght

Think of all the fella's that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
if you check off my Christmas list

Santa baby,I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
Been an angel all year
Santa baby,so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa honey,one little thing I really need
The deed to a platinum mine
Santa baby,so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa cutie,and fill my stocking with the duplex and checks
Sign your 'x' on the line
Santa cutie,and hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

Santa baby,forgot to mention one little thing
A ring,I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby,so hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry,tonight"
Pop,"London let's go! (x3)
Sugababes let's go

She got her red pumps, red purse
She gonna make some necks jerk tonight, eh
Hit the ATM, get that wad
She gonna party round the clock here tonight, eh

Went and got her car washed just so she can pull like ""what's up?"", ""what's up""
(what's up) (x5)
Now she and her girls 'bout to start a riot when they hit the club

And now they at the bar drinking...
Bottle after, bottle after, bottle after, bottle after, hey!

She's such a mess (such a mess)
Up in a dress (up in a dress)
She's sweating bullets (sweating bullets)
I'm not impressed (i'm not impressed)
Her make-up's running (her make-up's running)
Her heels are broke (her heels are broke)
But that won't stop her
Watch her get messed up some mo-mo-mo-mo-mo-more

EVERYBODY GO MAD, EVERYBODY GO PSYCHO, PSYCHO, PSYCHO
EVERYBODY GO MAD, EVERYBODY GO PSYCHO, PSYCHO

It's two in the morning
They ain't serving no more alcohol tonight, eh
She's got a four-seater filled with nine people
She don't even know tonight, eh

'Bout to hit the after party
Tomorrow she might be sorry but it's alright, eh
(alright) (x5)
The sun is coming up but she's filling up her cup
Yeah that's right

Chorus

EVERYBODY GO MAD, EVERYBODY GO PSYCHO, PSYCHO, PSYCHO
EVERYBODY GO MAD, EVERYBODY GO PSYCHO, PSYCHO

This is how them girls get down
Just another night in London town
They ain't trying to sober up, they keep drinking
Bottle after bottle after...
Champagnes flowing, music's going
A whole paycheck best believe she's blowing
'Cause it's so hard to stop when you're ordering
Bottle after bottle...

Chorus

EVERYBODY GO MAD, EVERYBODY GO PSYCHO, PSYCHO, PSYCHO
EVERYBODY GO MAD, EVERYBODY GO PSYCHO, PSYCHO

Up in that dress (a mess)

Good night, my love
Good night, my love

Good night, my love
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me

Before you go
There's just one thing I want to know
Is your love still warm for me
Or has it gone cold?

If you should awake
In the still of the night
Please have no fears
I'll be there
You know I care
Please give your love to me, dear

Totally ripped up my pantyhose

Pop,"I know you're gonna change the way you think of me
And so, I'm gonna show you how it supposed to be
I'm gonna finally make you see
I'm gonna make you learn your lesson with me

Cause I'm not the kind of girl who will lay down at your feet
Pedal back for your love, come whenever you call me
And I won't wait around, and I won't be your shadow
Lost in a world..........Cause I'm not that kind of girl

You don't even know what love is all about (You don't know what it's all about)
I won't hang around til you figured it out (Figure it out)
I'm gonna finally make you see
I'm gonna make you learn your lesson with me

Cause I'm not the kind of girl who will lay down at your feet
Pedal back for your love, let you win every battle
Just to keep you around, just to make you feel better
You can be sure..........
That I'm not the kind of girl who will lay down at your feet
Pedal back for your love, come whenever you call me
Cause that's not what I need, and that's not the way that
I see the world..........

I'm gonna finally make you see
I'm gonna make you learn your lesson with me

Cause I'm not the kind of girl who will lay down at your feet
Pedal back for your love, come whenever you call me
Cause you're not what I need

(And I'll never have to let you go)

And I, will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl

Say something, I'm giving up on you

an the love I can give
will always be yours for the long as I live.

I held you tight in the still of the night and the world was mine
I never knew that the nearness of you could be so divine.

A man's world but boy can't you see

And when you're sure
you'll never let her play you again
She'll put on your favourite smile
Unplug the phone to get you alone
Dirty dance
her hips will send you into a trance

Coz i'm cooler than the red dress
I'd rather catch a guy on my own (let me get it)
Coz what you see the man gets (don't forget it)
And if you don't I'm better off here alone

Done the candlelight to make you stay over
I'm giving it up now, baby
If that's what I've got to do to just own ya
I'm giving it up now, maybe

I've played the desperate lady
and jumped through all of the hoops boy
Instead of constante craving
I'll leave the chasing to you
And if you don't respect it
I'll kick with my Jimmy Choos
Coz boy if you don't love
Then I've got nothing to lose

Coz I've been down this road before
I should have known that I was to blame
Won't punt on your favourite smile
Unplug the phone to get you alone
Dirty dance
That's not the way I get my romance

And all the things you told me
That are holding me forever
Your smiling telling me I know it
And any time I needed you
You'd be right there whenever
I'll always hold the memories of times
We had together
I'm praying like that you still see me

If I could spend another time with you
With you, with you, with you
Then I would tell you everything, you already know
Already know, already know

I have so many things to say
But I'm sure that you already know that I miss you
Wo-oh
Smile and my world is a better thing
Cause even though you're not here with me
I know that you're not far
You're not far, not far

You picked me up every day right after school
I know that I would always thank to you for anything
You told me that I can always count on you
And even though that I would act a fool
You loved me, loved me

Cause every time I fall you pick me up
And I feel better
And all the things you told me

I know that you're not far

With never hours in the clock
You were my light to guide the way
No one seems to fall apart
And my heart the same
It sounds like this wouldn't need you
You always knew just what to say
And now I hope that you can hear me
But I really miss you

Be my, be my, be my little baby
My one and only baby
Say you'll be my darling
Be my baby now
My one and only baby

I'll make you happy, baby
Just wait and see
For every kiss you give me
I'll give you three
Oh, since the day I saw you
I have been waiting for you
You know I will adore you
Till eternity so won't you please

Be my baby now
My one and only baby"

And now I'm coming alive

But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me

I ain't the way you remember me

So fragile but no more

I jumped the fence to the other side (the other side)
My whole world was electrified (electrifide)
Now I'm no longer afraid
It's Independence Day

My name is Olly nice to meet you can I tell you, baby
Look around there's a whole pretty ladies
But not like you, you shine so bright, yeah

On the floor up and close getting lost in it
I won't give up without a fight

I just wanna
OOh baby

So come on
OOh baby
I just want you to dance with me tonight

We're getting sweaty, hot and heavy in the crowd now
Loosen up and let your hands go downtown
Go with it girl, yeah just close your eyes, yeah

I feel the music moving through your body
Looking at you I can tell you want me
Don't stop keep going till the morning light, yeah

When I saw you there
Sitting all alone in the dark
Acting like you didn't have a care
I knew right then you'd be mine
We'd be dancing the whole damn night right

OOh baby
I just want you to dance with me tonight
So come on
OOh baby

All through the night
I just want you to dance with me tonight"
Pop,"You know I'd fall apart without you
I don't know how you do what you do
'Cause everything that don't make sense about me
Makes sense when I'm with you
Like everything that's green, girl, I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You gotta know you're wanted too

'Cause I wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips, I
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you Mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
Yeah, I, I wanna make you feel wanted

Anyone can tell you you're pretty (yeah)
And you get that all the time, I know you do
But your beauty's deeper than the makeup
And I wanna show you what I see tonight

When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips, I
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
'Cause, baby, I, I wanna make you feel wanted

As good as you make me feel
I wanna make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales
Better than your best dreams
You're more than everything I need
You're all I ever wanted

And I just wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips, I
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you Mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
Yeah, I, I wanna make you feel wanted
Yeah, baby I, I wanna make you feel wanted
'Cause you'll always be wanted"
Pop,"You would make a mistake
If you think I'm not awake
I know what's goin' on
You've been lying to me
But I don't want to set you free
I know what's goin' on

I'm the one who makes you happy,
You got to know that for sure
(can't we give our love just one more try
Make it better than it was before)

Did you try to resist
Was she longing to be kissed
I know what's going on
Does she whisper does she sing
Does she say you're everything
I know what's going on

I will wait for this to end
Cause I know you'll need a friend
When at last she breaks your heart
Cause the only way to win
Is to get you back again
Until then I'll fall apart

I know what's going on

Alt verse
(You have changed who you are
I been watching from afar)"
Pop,"You found yourself alone a room
Total devastation
In the darkness you must stand to the cold
And crack the combination all on your own

Pick yourself up and search for the light
Hungry for a new start
It's your chance now to stand up and fight
Take the next step now a day at a time
Open up, open up, everybody's waiting
From high above, feel the love
Open up your windows

Let in the sun
Let in the sun
Let in the sun
Just let in the sun

Good to see you with your feet on the track
Waiting for a restart
Leaving comfort once was holding you back
Want you to see the sunrise as fast as you can

Pick it up, turn it round
Want you to see the sunrise as fast as you can
Open up, open up everybody's waiting
From high above, feel the love
Open up your windows

Let in the sun
Let in the sun
Let in the sun
Just let in the sun

Feel the air you're breathing in
Feel the warmth upon your skin
Looking out and looking in
OOh
Every colour in your eyes
In reflection of the light
Every minute every night

Open up, open up everybody's waiting
From high above, feel the love
Open up your windows

Let in the sun
Let in the sun
Let in the sun
Let in the sun
Just let in the sun
Ohh let in the sun
Let in the sun
Let in the sun"
Pop,"When we met
The sparkle in your eyes
Showed me that
We were meant to be
In love
Sharing our fantasies
You touched me
Then we kissed
I could not believe
That love was so strong
It didn't take too long
To learn
Love will go on and on
Love's an everlasting bond

When I'm next to you
Our love flows through
I can't explain
What you do
When I'm next to you
I feel brand new
I love you for
All the things you do

Can't deny
The feelings deep inside
Our hearts and minds
Love is alive
It's true
I'm so into you
I love you

Solo

When I'm next to you
Our love flows through
I can't explain
What you do
When I'm next to you
I feel brand new
I love you for
All the things you do

You know when I'm all alone
And you're so far away
I wish that you were here
Holding me
And I find myself thinking
Of how it would be
Knowing you're with me

I love the way I feel
"
Pop,"In the bible one thousand years BC
There's a story of ancient history
Bout a fell who was strong as he could be
Till he met a cheating gal who brought him tradgedy

Chorus
So run Sampson run, Delilah's on her way
Run Sampson run, you ain't got time to stay
Run Sampson run, on your marks you'd better start
I'd sooner trust a hungry lion than a gal with a cheatin' heart

She was a demon, a devil in disguise
He was taken, by the angel in her eyes
That lady barber, was very well equipped
You can bet your bottom dollar he was gonna get clipped

Chorus

Oh Delilah made Sammie's life a sin
And he perished, when the roof fell in
There's a moral, so listen to me pal
There's a little of Delilah in each and every gal

Chorus
"
Pop,"When we were together
We were just strangers
I was just playing around
So I didn't wanna work it out
Yeah, I didn't wanna work it out

Got something else missing
We were too different
Baby I've been looking back now
I really should've worked it out
Yeah, I really should've worked it out

Because now that you're gone
And I sleep alone
I can't help it, I want you back
'Cause I

Boy I miss you
Said I really do
Boy I miss you
You don't understand that we're better together
Boy I miss you
Said I really, really do
Boy I miss you
You don't understand that we're better together
We're better
You know that we're better together
We're better
You know that we're better together

I'm watching you with her
Thinking I had you
I was like I was so dumb
Boy I should've known that you're the one
Yeah, I should've known that you're the one

So if it's not too late
I just wanna know
If maybe we can see what went wrong
Because I really know that you're the one
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that you're the one

Because now that you're gone
And I sleep alone
I can't help it, I want you back
Cause I

Boy I miss you
Said I really do
Boy I miss you
You don't understand that we're better together
Boy I miss you
Said I really, really do
Boy I miss you
You don't understand that we're better together
We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better
You know that we're better together
We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better
You know that we're better together

And now that you're gone
And I sleep alone
I can't help it, I want you back
Cause I

We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better
You know that we're better together
We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better
You know that we're better together

Boy I miss you
Said I really do
Boy I miss you
You don't understand that we're better together
Boy I miss you
Said I really, really do
Boy I miss you
You don't understand that we're better together
We're better
You know that we're better together"
Pop,"Konichiwa Records Headquarters


You can't stop it You can't escape it You can't turn
it off
So I'd appreciate your kind consideration in this
matter
Sir or Mam would you please turn it the fuck up
Do it

Unleashed in the east
Best dressed in the west
Sorted in the north
Without a doubt in the south

The queen of queen bees
Lioness of Judah
Phoenix from the ashes risen

Undefeated undisputed featherweight champion
on all five continents

World record holder with a high score of two gazillion
in Tetris
Two-time recipient of the Nobel prize for super
foxiest female ever
and war time consigliere to the Cosa Nostra

She split the atom, invented the x-ray,
the cure for AIDS, and the surprise
blindfold greeting

She performed and choreographed the fights
for Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon
and Game of death and still does stunt doubles
for Jackie Chan on the weekends

She suckerpunched Einstein, outsmarted Ali, and
even outsuperfreaked Rick James
She's the founder and CEO of Konichiwa Records
The most decorated professional field operative in the
industry
and in the streets
With a perfect track record since kindergarten where
she used to
whoop schoolboy ass

She's listed in section 202 of the United
Nations Security Act of 1979
as being too hot to wear tight sweaters on
international airspace
In this world of tension pressure and pain
she is known by men and women of all origin and faith
for her wisdom, compassion, and relentless
determination in the quest to get paid"
Pop,"She's strutting down the street
With a diamond necklace
The size of a dime
It looks real nice
When it shines
It lights up the world around her
But it's only in her mind

He's speeding up the road
In his red ferrari
Goes so fast always in a hurry
What's the point if ya get dead in the scurry
You'll be leaving it all behind

What a shame it is (doesn't' have to be that way)
So lame it is (gonna have to pay to play)
A game like this (that's the way it is)
Unless ya know

What's real
Is the beauty inside your soul
What's real
Is that everyone's gonna get old
What's real
Is the time that you take to check in
Not the sale of material things
They fade
And all you're left with is how ya feel
And that's what's real

She gotta go gotta fly
Doesn't stop to kiss her kid
Be good is all she said
As she's grabbing her keys and escaping her life
She said she'd be home soon but she lied

And her kid tells her friends at school
That her mom is really cool
Smiles for the camera
Gets her face in all the magazines
It's a superficial beauty scene

And they keep in touch (but she's such a lonely girl)
But it don't mean much (livin' in a lonely world)
'cause I heard her say (tryin to be brave she)
Can't help her wondering

[Chorus]

Love each other while u still got time
Tell your mother she's been on your mind
Kiss your brother just 'cause he looks fine
Wear the red dress
Love at first sight
Put the top down
Feel the sunshine

[Chorus]"

No there ain't nothing stopping me

But oh, she's hot
And oh, my gosh
I gotta take a deep breath
I gotta walk right up and tell this girl
She coming home with me

Gotta do it quick before she goes
True love don't wait, wait, wait

Okay, listen
Hold up a second, let me check myself
Have I got something stuck in my teeth? (Yeah yeah, just there, just there)
She's a knockout, ain't no average girl
I'm punching way out of my league

Pop,"Here come old flattop he come grooving up slowly
He got joo-joo eyeball he one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker he just do what he please

He wear no shoeshine he got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger he shoot coca-cola
He say ""I know you, you know me""
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
Come together right now over me

He bag production he got walrus gumboot
He got Ono sideboard he one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease
Come together right now over me

He roller-coaster he got early warning
He got muddy water he one mojo filter
He say ""One and one and one is three""
Got to be good-looking 'cause he's so hard to see
Come together right now over me"
Pop,"I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

I was beat incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue

Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

Pop,"I was lonely
A gypsy always running wild and free (Free, Free)
Until you showed me
All that I never could see (See, See)

What I need, I don't know
But you're in my dreams wherever I go
This feeling is here to stay

I am a border girl
Crossing oceans in the name of love
And I have been searching for this all of my life
My heart knows when it's wrong and when it's right
Oh

When you touch me
You take away the pain of my silence (silence)
Don't have to worry
No games that I have to play (play play)
(No games that I have to play)

I was lost, now I'm found
And baby in your arms I'm on solid ground
It's good to feel this way

I am a border girl
Crossing oceans in the name of love
And I have been searching for this all of my life
My heart knows when it's wrong and when it's right
Oh

Every step I take is to you
I go anywhere you want me to
Cause I know what it means to have fought forever

I am a border girl (Iiiiiiii, yeah)
Crossing oceans in the name of love (In the name of love)
And I have been searching for this all of my life
My heart knows when it's wrong and when it's right
Oh (For all my life)

I am a border girl
Crossing oceans in the name of love
And I have been searching for this all of my life (I've been searching al lmy life for you)

Pop,"If I were somebody else
I'd be calling me stupid
But I still do this

No way that you're gonna change
Nothing to say that I wanna hear
I gotta get outta here
I've been driving down this road

With my eyes closed
Tryin' to get lost
But I know I'll be back again

And it's easy to escape
But as long as there's a way I can reach you
I know it's never gonna be over

I'm throwin' matches
I'm lighting dynamite
It never catches
This bridge won't burn
I dropped the lighter into the gasoline
No fire
This bridge won't burn burn bur"
Pop,"Every minute passes by
You're always talking
Makes me cry
Finding out the reasons why
I'm needing space get out my ride
Talking about what I do, where I go, who I'm with and why I don't bring you
Think about the times you pushed me
Saying ""baby please don't go""
You make me sick
Yeah, yeah

I'll make you lost in
Times before you break my small
You claim you love me, tease me, leave me, hold me, please me
Get off I'm movin on
Cos I'm tryin to take control

Chorus:
But it's you talking dirty
When I'm trying to sleep
And it's you, said you love me
After just one week
Tell me who's always calling on my telephone
Now it's you tryin to tell me
We should take things slow

And you said: ""don't go, don't go, please don't go
Please don't leave me, on my own
Don't go, don't go, please don't go
Please don't leave me, on my own""

You're creepin, sneaking, cheating, on me
Leavin, this round,
Gotta end the strike cos it ain't going down
Now you wanna come back, claim you give me a track
I forgive what you do then you want it back
I'm sick of playing this game
I ain't sticking with a claim fame
Stop this, right now
You crossed the line so baby get the hell out

Make up your mind boy
Silly games you're always playing
Have no time boy
To sit and chase you
I ain't staying
Well, thinking it's funny
Well, you're spending money
And, every time you wanna get the upper hand remember
I'll be walking away looking cool with my
Matching bag and the jewels that I took
Don't you ever say it's not necessary
Then beg to come back
I ain't having that
Ooh whoa

Pop,"You hurt my mind, you hurt my soul
Never believing what I'm saying
I'll hunt you down, I'll make you mine
You'll be the game I've started playing
And if you won't be there I will know where you're going
And if you won't be there I will try everyway of showing you that

You are the one, you are the one
The one for me
You are the one, you are the one
The one I need

You understand, you realise
The scene that I'm creating
And all the while you compromise
On the liberties I'm taking
If you don't believe I want just you and I together
Then you won't believe the dream of you and I forever because

You are the one, you are the one
The one for me
You are the one, you are the one

Then I'm afraid what can't be paid must be returned
You never, ever learn that nothing's yours
On easy terms.

Only for a time
I must not learn to call you mine
Familiarize
That face, those eyes
Make future plans that cannot be confirmed on borrowed time
On easy terms.

Living on the never never
Constant as the changing weather
Never sure
Who's at the door
Or the price I'll have to pay

Should we meet again?

I will not recognize your name
You can be sure what's gone before will be concealed
Your friends will never learn that once we were
On easy terms

Living on the never never
Constant as the changing weather

Blue sky, sky, sky, sky, sky
Tune into the sound
Of my underground
Bright lights
Blue sky, sky, sky, sky, sky

Drop

Makes me wanna rock
I got a boombox so give me your cd

Tune into the sound
Of my underground
Bright lights
Blue sky, sky, sky, sky, sky

Tune into the sound
Of my underground
Bright lights
Blue sky, sky, sky, sky, sky"
Pop,"No, I think I'll stay in tonight
Skip the conversations
and the ""oh, I'm fine""s
No, I'm no stranger to surprise
This paper town has let me down
Too many times
Why do I even try?
Give me a reason why
I thought that I could trust you, never mind
Why are we switching sides?
Where do I draw the line?
I guess I'm too naive to read the signs

I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town

Oh, ohh
Ohh, ah

I stay up
Talkin' to the moon
And feelin' so alone
In every crowded room
Can't help but feel like
Something's wrong, yeah
'Cause the place I'm livin' in
Just doesn't feel like home

I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town

Lookin' for some new friends
Oh, ohh
Ohh, ah

I just wanna talk about nothin'
With somebody that means something
Spell the names of all our dreams and demons
For the times that I don't understand
Tell me what's the point of a moon like this
When I'm alone again
Can I run away to somewhere beautiful
Where nobody knows my name?

I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
But I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town

Oh, ohh
Ohh, ah"

Pop,"Hoped you were different, babe
But you're all the same
So beautiful, so insane
Yeah, it's crossed my mind just a couple times
I must resist your love, gotta put up a fight

When you dance for me, dance for me
How can I resist the way you move?
Shawty, you're breaking me, breaking me
I don't understand the things you do

Baby, I know your type
Your body can control my mind
And damn, you look good tonight
Heaven knows, I know you ain't right
Cause baby, I know you're tight
Your body can control my mind
And damn, you look good tonight
Can't help but worry, worry
Cause my vision's blurry

My vision's blurry
My, my vision's blurry
My vision's blurry

So much energy you could take from me
Then tear my heart in two way too easily
Heard the words they said, might take a chance instead
You got a hold on me, shame messing with my head

When you dance for me, dance for me
How can I resist the way you move?
Shawty, you're breaking me, breaking me
I don't understand the things you do

Baby, I know your type
Your body can control my mind
And damn, you look good tonight
Heaven knows, I know you ain't right
Cause baby, I know you're tight
Your body can control my mind
And damn, you look good tonight
Can't help but worry, worry
Cause my vision's blurry

My vision's blurry
My, my vision's blurry
My, my, my vision's blurry
My vision's blurry"
Pop,"This is the last time
You leave me with no choice
Cos we kiss with closed eyes
And I've reached my breaking point
I'll never forget you
But I can't take anymore
Cos we can't remember
What we're even fighting for

I can't be what you want me to be
I can only be myself
I can't see what you want me to see
I can only see this
Distance getting bigger
Guess we never figured
We'd be way we are so
I can't be what you want me to be
Stop tryna change me

This is the last time
I'm ready to close the door
Cos two hearts are broken
The pieces left on the floor
I never said that I was flawless
I never said I was the perfect man
But when you look at me I notice
That you're unhappy with who I am

OOh

I can't be what you want me to be
I can only be myself
I can't see what you want me to see
I can only see this
Distance getting bigger
Guess we never figured
We'd be way we are so
I can't be what you want me to be
Stop tryna change me

OOh ooh stop tryna change me
OOh ooh stop tryna change me

This is the ending
Lets start pretending
That I'll ever be what you need
You can't change me

I can't be what you want me to be
I can only be myself
I can't see what you want me to see
I can only see this
Distance getting bigger
Guess we never figured
We'd be way we are so
I can't be what you want me to be
Stop tryna change me

OOh ooh stop tryna change me
OOh ooh stop tryna change me"
Pop,"I was like, ""Hi, nice to meet ya""
I could see me in your T-shirt
I could hear love from the speakers
I could see us in front of a preacher
Saying ""I do"" in my white dress
Fell so deep, I need a life vest
It don't usually happen like this
Nah nah, nah nah (Whoo)

And I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew
Knew I had to lock it down
Lock it down, lock it down
I said I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew
Knew I had to lock it down
Lock it down, lock it down (Uh)

They say that fools rush in
But I, oh I, I wanna be foolish with you
I wanna be foolish with you
They say that fools rush in
But I, oh I (Hey) , I wanna be foolish with you
I wanna be foolish with you (Whoo)

This ain't no one night stand
Want yo picture on my nightstand
Be my lover, be my best friend
Put that bling bling on my left hand
Saying, ""What kinda love you gon' put on me?
'Cause your last name sounds good on me""
""What kinda love you gon' put on me?
'Cause your last name sounds good on me""

And I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew
Knew I had to lock it down
Lock it down, lock it down

They say that fools rush in
But I, oh I, I wanna be foolish with you (Foolish with you)
I wanna be foolish with you (Say it again, say it)
They say that fools rush in
But I, oh I (Oh I) , I wanna be foolish with you (Foolish with you)
I wanna be foolish with you (Come on, say)

They say that fools rush in
(They say fools rush in, but I wanna be)
But I, oh I, I wanna be foolish with you (Foolish with you)
I wanna be foolish with you (Foolish with you)
They say that fools rush in
(They say fools rush in, but I wanna be)
But I, oh I, I wanna be foolish with you (Foolish with you)
I wanna be foolish with you (Foolish with you) (Oh, say)

Oh, they say fools rush in (But I)

They say (Fools rush in)

Oh, they say fools rush in
But I wanna be foolish with you, I wanna be foolish with you"
Pop,"Did you ever really start to cry over something you just wrote?
Well I'm writing you, my dear St. Nick, it's the saddest little note.
Is it fair come this Christmas Eve that I should be alone,
when she knows how much I'm missing her, would you kindly bring her home?

This boy's letter to Santa Claus it's gonna tear him up,
when he reads how much I'm missing her it's gonna tear him up.
I'm sure if all his reindeers could arrange room on his sleigh
then I'd receive a big bright package and she'd be mine today.

I'll be missing you come Christmas, wishing hard, my dear,
missing you come Christmas, wishing you were here.

Did you ever really start to cry over something that was said?
Well, I'm writing you, dear Santa, it's the saddest thing you ever read.
Is it fair come this Christmas time that I should be without you,
you know how much I NEED you, girl, won't you kindly help me through?

This boy's letter to Santa Claus it's gonna tear him up,
when he reads how much I'm missing her it's gonna tear him up.
I'm sure he'll write a special note to remind him Christmas Eve
that he has to mend a broken heart that believes in make believe.

Right above his VIP we'll be ranking number one,
no sadder request will he receive he'll know it has to be done.

Hey, Santa, if you're my friend, please take heed, it's not pretend.
This boy's letter....
I'm sure if all ....

Oh, Santa, I'll be missing you come Christmas, wishing hard, my dear,"
Pop,"I'm confused, I don't know
Which way do I really go
This guy is fly
But another one pass me by
Stuck in the middle of this spot
That is too damn hot
Shall I choose the one
With the heavy car or not
'coz nothing ain't serious
See I'm only seventeen
And I wanna be mysterious
Naughty, sexy on the creep
Never sleep
Won't reveal the sneaky side of me

All day and night I creep out
I think about who I'm gonna go and link up
Don't think that I'm innocent, baby
'coz this is driving me crazy
Tell me what do you see
I'm not an innocent girl

You don't know where we go
You don't know
That we're angels with dirty faces in the morning
You don't know we've been on the town low
You don't know that we're missing to the morning

I'd say that I'm the kind of girl
You'd say is shy
But I don't think that's the answer
You'd hear if you asked my guy
I'm just a girl who likes to let it go
Party with my ladies 'til dawn
Still don't just let it go

Move your heads to the beat
And shake it down like you never did before
Move a little closer come with me
I'll show you the place to be
That's what he said to me

You don't know where we go
You don't know
That we're angels with dirty faces in the morning
You don't know we've been on the town low
You don't know that we're missing to the morning

You don't know where we go
You don't know
That we're angels with dirty faces in the morning
You don't know we've been on the town low
You don't know that we're missing to the morning

We're the type of girls don't think
Just say everything we want
We know we'll get our own way
Sexy, classy
Don't think you'll put it past me
Angels in the day
But at night could be nasty
Keisha: wanna have the fellas locked on ice
Mutya: wanna play around with them like dice
Heidi: he didn't know I was a freak until he met me after dark
He thought this girl was a chic

You don't know where we go
You don't know
That we're angels with dirty faces in the morning
You don't know we've been on the town low
You don't know that we're missing to the morning

You don't know where we go
You don't know
That we're angels with dirty faces in the morning
You don't know we've been on the town low
You don't know that we're missing to the morning

You don't know where I go"
Pop,"Ooohh, oohhhhhh

When the visions around you, bring tears to your eyes
And all that surrond you, are secrets and lies
I'll be your strength, I'll give you hope, keeping your faith when its gone
The one you should call, was standing here all along

And I will take you in my arms, and hold you right where you belong
'Til the day my life is through, this I promise you
This I promise you

I've loved you forever, in lifetimes before
And I promise you never, will you hurt anymore
I give you my word, I give you my heart
This is a battle we've won
And with this vow forever has now begun

Just close your eyes, each loving day
And know this feeling won't go away, nooo
'Til the day my life is through, this I promise you
This I promise you

Over and over I fall, when I hear you call
Without you in my life baby
I just wouldn't be living at all

And I will take, (I will take you in my arms), you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong (right where you belong)
'Til the day my life is through, this I promise you baby

Just close your eyes, each loving day(each loving day)
And know this feeling won't go away, (no)
Every word I say is true, this I promise you

Every word I say is true, this I promise you

Oooh I promise you"
Pop,"Every single morning I wake up and there's a moment of bliss
Then I remember,
I get up and I get on with what I chose but oh how I wish,
We could go back in time
And find the part we lost
Go back to where we started off
Every single morning I wake up

And I've been waiting, right here
For things to get better
And I've been patient, trying to figure this out
Everyone else is saying,
What don't kill you makes you stronger
So why do I feel so weak?
So weak
So weak

I can feel you loving me
Like tiny little wounds when I breath,
And time is so unkind
And I am covered up in scars
That should be starting to heal
But I'm not moving
It's like I'm stuck in fantasies,
Rerunning made up memories
I can feel you loving me baby

And I've been waiting, right here
For things to get better
And I've been patient, trying to figure this out
Everyone else is saying
What don't kill you makes you stronger
So why do I feel so weak?
So weak
So weak

And I hate the way I feel, I can?t control myself
It""s like you stripped away my strength
And made me someone else
Why am I stuck here?
Cos I've been waiting, ooh
And I've been patient
Everyone else is saying
What don't kill you makes you stronger
So why do I feel so weak?

Cos I've been waiting, right here
For things to get better
And I've been patient, trying to figure this out
Everyone else is saying
What don't kill you makes you stronger
So why do I feel so weak?
So weak
So weak
So weak..."

Pop,"So many times
I thought I held it in my hands
But just like grains of sand
Love slipped through my fingers

So many nights
I asked the Lord above
Please make me lucky enough
To find a love that lingers

Something keeps telling me
You could be my answer prayer
You must be heaven sent
I swear

(Chorus)
Cause something happens when you look at me
I forget to speak
Something happens when you kiss my mouth
My knees get so weak
Could it be true this is what God has meant for me
Cause baby I can't believe something like you
Could happen to me

Girl in your eyes
I feel your fire burn (feel your fire)
All your secrets I will learn
Even if it takes forever

With you by my side
I can do anything(can't do anything)
I don't care what tommorrow brings
As long as we're together

My heart is telling me
That you could be my meant to be
I know it more each time
We touch

(Chorus)

Something magical(something magical)
Something spiritual(something spiritual)
Something stronger than the two of us alone( yea)
Something physical
Something undeniable
Nothing like anything(nothing like anything)
That I've ever known

Pop,"My love
Was filled with trouble
With indecision,theraphy and pain

You know that my love
It was going nowhere
It would have driven any normal man insane

Oh,but then she said she wanted to dance
She said she wanted to move
She said she wanted a good time
Girl,I think I love you

My love
As bad as fast food
As low as dueces in a gamblers hand

You know that my love
Was long,long hang over
Ain't got no houses or no money or no land

Oh,but then she said she wanted to dance
She said she wanted to move
She said she wanted a good time
Girl,I think I love you

Shake it
Everybody now shake it
Everybody just step to the right,jump up,turn around and shake it

Everybody now boogey
Everybody now boogey
Everybody put your hands in the air,turn around everybody
Let's boogey

My love
Was filled with trouble
With indecision,therapy and pain

You know that my love
It was going nowhere

I'm ready let's hit the town
I can feel it now
Pushing away the doubt
And it's got me going
Lights are glowing
Pulling me through the crowd

Lost in the music, we're dancing like no-one's here
I feel the heat of your skin as you pull me near

I go in and out of love
Never get enough

Pop,"Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll
My windows down and cruise
Hey baby!
When I first saw him, first day summer
He's poppin' right out of the south georgia water
Thought, oh my my, he trough me out my head
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

He was looking so southern and singin' marshall tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
I hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle

Every little farm town with you
In this brand new chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

My windows down, my seats are back
My music up and we ride
My feel up on his dashboard
And that's just the way I like
Hey country boy, this country girl
Like everything about you
Don't change a thing, no way
You stay the same and I got you

Goodnight summer sun fall to his knees
And I looked at him and he looked at me
And he turned on those cassi lights
That drove all night, cause ir felt so right
Him and I, and it feels so right
Heeling mark, and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Boy you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Yeah I can't get you out of my head!

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
Come on! So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise"
Pop,"I can leave you right now,
Pick up the phone and say we're through,
Even though we both know I'll come right back to you.

It's a fact I need you, you're the oxygen I breathe
You're running through my veins under my skin,
You're no good for me.

I know I gotta give you up, but I just can't let you go
Save my love for another, cause it's wasted on you.

And even though you drown me,
I keep holding on to you,
I can't let you go,
My love's wasted on you.

And even though I'm no fool,
I know I'll just pass it through,
But now I know my love's wasted on you.

If only I could hate you,
I mean, I try but I just can't.
But maybe I could find you in the arms of another man.

Even though we both know
It's the beginning to our end
I'm running out of excuses,
Lying to myself, keep thinking you can change.

I know I gotta give you up, but I just can't let you go
Save my love for another, cause it's wasted on you.

And even though you drown me,
I keep holding on to you,
I can't let you go,
My love's wasted on you.

And even though I'm no fool,
I know I'll just pass it through,
But now I know my love's wasted on you.

I'm not thinking of you,
I'm not broken in two,
I'm not looking back,
My love's wasted on you.
I'm not thinking of you,
I'm not broken in two,
I'm not looking back,
My love's wasted on you.
I'm not thinking of you,
I'm not broken in two,
I'm not looking back,
My love's wasted on you.

It's all wasted, it's all wasted,
It's all wasted, it's all wasted,
It's all wasted on you."
Pop,"There's a river of tears I need to cry
Been holding back for years
There's a mountain so high i need to climb
To wipe away the fears
Solitude and loneliness
Have been a friend of mine
As I'm turning my back on emptiness
I leave them all behind

Who knows
Just where I'm going
Does tomorrow belong to me

Walk away this time with my head up high
Walk away just me and myself
Walk away with pride nothing left to hide
But it just feels right to be one
And just walkaway

I could never forget how hard I tried
When we were oh so young
Just one tender moment I cannot find
Well maybe I had none
Strength will be by my side
Although I feel afraid
But I know it's too late for this goodbye
There's nothing left to say

Who knows
Just where I'm going
Does tomorrow belong to me

Walk away this time with my head held high
Walk away just me and myself
Walk away with pride nothing left to hide
But it just feels right to be one
And just walkaway this time

One day you'll realise
That the tears you saw in my eyes
Will be there forever

Walk away this time with my head up high
Walk away just me and myself
Walk away with pride nothing left to hide
But it just feels right to be one
And just walkaway

Just walkaway
And just walkaway

Pop,"I get up in the morning and I see your face, girl
Your'e looking so good, everythings in place
Don't you know I could never leave your side girl
Won't you stay here with me and be my bride?
Don't you know you're everything,don't you know you're alright
The only girl I've always needeed for so long
Chorus:
Oh,oh-oh, she's my cover girl
Oh,oh-oh,oh-oh
Oh,oh-oh,she's my cover girl
Oh,oh-oh,oh-oh

When I look through the pages of a magazine
Still, your pretty face is the prettiest I've seen
Don't you know I only want to be with you
No other girl could make me feel the way you do
You're my everything

Chorus twice

It's alright
Oh, yeah, it's out of sight
Let me say it's alright
Ah,yeah!

Don't you know I only want to be with you
No other girl could make me feel the way you do
You're my everthing

Chorus and fade
"
Pop,"Like a roller coaster,
My life is full of ups and downs
Sometimes are silly things
That make me think about
The past and the future
So fast, they are happening
And leaving everything behind
And confusing my mind
And confusing my mind

[Chorus]
I don't know why
Everything does not slow down
That would be better
We could have more fun
And stop living on that countdown
But it doesn't matter
But it doesn't matter for you"
Pop,"Wise men say, only fools sin
But I took your hand and jumped right in
I guess everything has a consequence, oh I, I
I can hide, and put on a show
'Cause the high are highs
But the lows are lows
You control me more than you've ever known
But I wouldn't have it any other way

Must be love
Or this wouldn't hurt so much
And I wouldn't think so much
And I could just give you up, up, oh
It must be love
Or this wouldn't hurt so much
And I wouldn't think so much
And I could just give you up, oh

I fall hard, that's just how I am
And I bend and break like a rubber band
Everything gets through after two AM
So don't, don't, don't look at me like that
When you're the one that implied that
'Cause I'm gonna look at you right back
I promise you ain't gonna like that, yeah
We fuss and we fight, forget and ignite
And I wouldn't have it any other way

Must be love
Or this wouldn't hurt so much
And I wouldn't think so much
And I could just give you up, up, oh
It must be love
Or this wouldn't hurt so much
And I wouldn't think so much
And I could just give you up, up, oh

Love, love, love
And I could just give you up
Love

Must be love
Or this wouldn't hurt so much (so much)
And I wouldn't think so much
And I could just give you up, up

Must be love
Yeah
Must be love
L-O-V-E"
Pop,"There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare

See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat

Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one of you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it
With the beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind
And reap just what you sow
We could've had it all
We could've had it all
It all, it all it all

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it
To the beat"
Pop,"Sugar
Sugar
mmm ... ooh

She sits alone waiting for suggestions
He's so nervous avoiding all her questions
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking?

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so

He's acting shy looking for an answer
Come on, honey, let's spend the night together
Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother
They catch a cab to his high rise apartment
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so

His heart's beating like a drum
'Cause at last he's got his girl home
Relax, baby, now we are alone

[break]

They wake at dawn 'cause all the birds are singing
Two total strangers but that ain't what they're thinking
Outside it's cold, misty and it's raining
They got each other, neither one's complaining
He say's I'm sorry but I'm out of milk and coffee
Never mind, sugar, we can watch the early movie

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so
Tell me so, baby"
Pop,"You and me
Had some history
Had a semblance of honesty
All that has changed now
We shared words
Only lover speak
How can it be
We are less than strangers

Oh it hurts to lose in love
Let anger and cruelty win
It’s unfair that you doubt your feelings
And that you’ll ever love again
I know that hearts can change
Like the seasons and the wind
But when I said forever
I thought that we’d always be friends

You and me had some history
Had a semblance of honesty
All that has changed now
We shared words
Only lovers speak
How can it be
We are less than strangers

I thought I saw you yesterday
I thought I passed you on the street
I swear I saw your face
I was not imagining
That you stole a glance my way
You walked away from me
My heart it may be broken
But my eyes are dry to see

You and me had some history
Had a semblance of honesty
All that has changed now
We shared words
Only lovers speak
How can it be
We are less than strangers"
Pop,"We kiss in a shadow, we hide from the moon,
our meetings are few and over too soon!
We speak in a whisper afraid to be heard
when people are near, we speak not a word!

Alone in our secret together we sigh
for one smiling day to be free!

To kiss in the sunlight and say to the sky
behold and believe what you see,
behold how my lover loves me!

Alone in our secret together we sigh
for one smiling day to be free!

To kiss in the sunlight and say to the sky
behold and believe what you see.
behold how my lover loves me!"
Pop,"I don't wanna be the other woman
I know you're not the cheatin' kind
But I see you every night in a fever dream
I just can't get you out of my mind

I'll be alright
If you eliminate the night
I'll be okay
Take all these burnin' hours away
Oh, eliminate, eliminate the night

No other man in this room tonight, no other man in this town
Make me say these wicked words, make me lay my conscience down
Oh honey when it comes to you, I ain't got no shame
You can have me any way you like, you can call me by her name

I'll be alright
If you eliminate the night
I'll be okay
Take all these burnin' hours away
Oh, eliminate, eliminate the night

There's a lot o' men on the floor tonight and gonna give 'em each a dance
But I'm makin' my every move for you, I'm ridin' on your every glance
I could leave in the mornin' before you awake and I really wouldn't mind to pretend
That I never held you and you can go on home and this'll never happen again

I'll be alright
If you eliminate the night
I'll be okay
Take all these burnin' hours away

I'll be alright
If you eliminate the night
I'll be okay
Take all these burnin' hours away
Oh, eliminate, eliminate the night

Oh, eliminate, eliminate the night
Oh, eliminate, eliminate the night"
Pop,"She's got a bad reputation
She takes the long way home
All of my friends seen her naked
Or so the story goes

Mistakes, we all make them
But they won't let it go
'Cause she's got a bad reputation
But I know what they don't

I don't care what they say about you, baby
They don't know what you've been through
Trust me
I could be the one that treat you like a lady
Let me see what's underneath
All I need is you

She's got a bad reputation
Nobody gets too close
A sight of a soul when it's breaking
Making my heart grow cold

And the deeper she's sinking, I'm begging her
Please, don't let go
She's got a bad raputation
She's all that
All I want, though

And I don't care what they say about you baby
They don't know what you've been through
Trust me
I could be the one that treat you like a lady
And let me see what's underneath
All I need is you

Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ohh
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ohh

Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
Nobody knows the weight that's on her shoulders, said
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
She got it bad
She got it bad
Nobody know's the way that I know her, said
Nobody knows the weight that's on her shoulders, said
Nobody know's the way that I know her, said
She got it bad
She got it bad

And I don't care what they say about you baby
But they don't know what you've been through
Trust me
I could be the one to treat you like a lady
Then we'll see what's underneath
All I need is you

She's got a bad reputation
She takes the long way home"
Pop,"You and me together -
Stars forever (4x)

You and me on the hood
On my car
Saturday night
Watching the stars (2x)

You and I
Shinning lights to what we are
Look at the sky

I can be right there next to you
No matter where in the world you are
I got you right here next to me
Forever connected through the stars
It's what we are...

We walk through the night
The moon shines down
Like a spotlight (2x)

Pop,"NEIL SEDAKA lyrics - Run Samson Run

In the bible, 1000 years BC
There's a story of ancient history
'Bout a fella who was strong as he could be
'Til he met a cheatin' gal who brought him tragedy

Oh, run Samson run, Delilah's on her way
Run Samson run, you ain't got time to stay
Run Samson run, on your mark you better start
I'd sooner trust a hungry lion
Than a gal with a cheatin' heart

She was a demon (was a demon)
A devil in disguise
He was taken (he was taken)
By the angel in her eyes
That lady barber (lady barber)
Was very well equipped
You can bet your bottom dollar
He was gonna get clipped

Oh, run Samson run, Delilah's on her way
Run Samson run, you ain't got time to stay
Run Samson run, on your mark you better start
I'd sooner trust a hungry lion
Than a gal with a cheatin' heart

Oh, Delilah (oh, Delilah)
Made Sammy's life a sin
And he perished (and he perished)
When the roof fell in
There's a moral (there's a moral)
So listen to me pal
There's a little of Delilah
In each and every gal

Soooo, run Samson run, Delilah's on her way
Run Samson run, you ain't got time to stay
Run Samson run, on your mark you better start
I'd sooner trust a hungry lion
Than a gal with a cheatin' heart
I'd sooner trust a hungry lion
Than a gal with a cheatin' heart"
Pop,"Never been asked to dance
'Cause I never been the pretty
Never like compliments

Pop,"Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart

Heide
Baby, baby
I'm aware of where you go
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love you'll meet

Keisha
But this time before you run to her
Leaving me alone and hurt
(Think it over) After I've been good to you?
(Think it over) After I've been sweet to you?

Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

Mary Wilson
I've known of your
Your secluded nights
I've even seen her
Maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?
But this time before you leave my arms
And rush of to her charms
(Think it over) Haven't I been good to you?
(Think it over) Haven't I been sweet to you?

Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

Amelle
I've tried so hard, hard to be patient
Hoping you'd stop this infatuation
But each time you are together
I'm so afraid I'll be losing you forever

Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart

Baby, think it over
Think it over, baby
Ooh, think it over baby

Pop,"What a wonderful world this is
What a wonderful world this is
It makes me want to kiss
What a beautiful kiss this is
What a beautiful kiss of life
Just before I die

I've been spending time
I've been losing time

Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep
Time can help you find the ground and knock you off your feet
All those minutes get lost in time
One step forward two steps behind
So before I think myself too deep
What a wonderful world this is

What a wonderful world this is
What a delicate tale of bliss
That I don't want to miss
In this moment where we all exist
On the precipice of the abyss
It always was, how it is

(Spending time)
I've been spending time,
(Wasting time)
I've been wasting time

Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep
Time can help you find the ground and knock you off your feet
All those minutes get lost in time
One step forward two steps behind
So before I think myself too deep
What a wonderful world this is

No time...
(Am I losing my mind)
No time...
(Am I losing my mind)
There's no time for us, no time for us until we're out of time (we're
Running out of time)
There's no time for us, no time
What a wonderful world this is
There's no time for us, no time (we're running out of time)

But it was never ours to keep
Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep
Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep)"

Pop,"She stood out just like a diamond lady
Amongst the tourists in a crowded room
I took her walking on the sandy beaches
Under a silver Carribean moon
That's when she promised that
And I promised this
And till this day I can still picture it
She took my hand
And I took her kiss
So temporary these moments of bliss
CHORUS:
Some dreams just fade away
Like yesterday's sunset
Some dreams are made to stay
She's one dream I'll never forget
Everyday just seemed to go too quickly
And ever night just passed us in a blur
I never noticed the blue skies and waters
Because I only had eyes for her
And so when she promised that
And I promised this
And to this day I can still picture it
She took my hand
And I took her kiss
So temporary these moments of bliss
REPEAT CHORUS
Roll back
Those crazy summer days
Stroll back
I'll find you through the haze
REPEAT CHORUS 2X"
Pop,"I think I'll buy a gun and blame it on my hometown
It's so cold in the deep
She asked me if I think I'll ever see her again
I say, ""Hopefully""

And maybe that's how it's supposed to be
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be

My heroes all died young, they hung themselves with fame
And these lunatics, molded me
I got a tattoo, it's a joke I keep a secret
I need everyone to notice me

But maybe that's how it's supposed to be
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be

I think I'll die young with all my broken dreams
I've got it figured out, this is the golden key
Everything is how it's supposed to be
Everything is how it's supposed to be

We messed it all up, now the world is getting warmer
L. A. will be out at open sea
Meanwhile, I'm falling down, my heart is getting colder
I hurt everyone close to me

But maybe that's how it's supposed to be
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be (Hey)

I think I'll die young with all my broken dreams
I've got it figured out, this is the golden key
The day my daddy died, I was down the street
I lost my only friend; people don't grow on trees
But maybe that's the way it's supposed to be
Yeah, I think that's the way it's supposed to be
Yeah, everything is how it's supposed to be

I think this is how it's supposed to be

Well, here we are. This is Sunday morning, October 2
1988, and this is Versagio and Lira
Versagio who I talked to last night wanted to see Michael
so there he is. Let's see if we can get him—Michael
look up here! Where you goin', Michael?
Yeah, okay. Anyway, he is a real good kid"
Pop,"Dumb down, let your crazy out
Boys go crazy over you
Grip like a New York window cleaner
Just staring at you
Youth don’t leave me
Hair stay on me
God I love those hips
Oh memory don’t for sake me
Not like this

All those pretty things
Don’t sweat the pretty things
So collectable
Why not collect them all?
Obviously cunningly womanly
All those pretty things
God bless the pretty things

They’re still out there somewhere
Making men feel this way
At Fulham Broadway station
I see them everyday all day
Download a little meditation
It might pull you through
She blinded me with silence, anchored here with…

All those pretty things
Don’t sweat the pretty things
So collectable
Why not collect them all
Obviously cunningly womanly
All those pretty things
God bless the pretty things

All those pretty things
Don’t sweat the pretty things
So collectable
Why not collect them all
Obviously cunningly womanly
All those pretty things
God bless the pretty things

Did she talk like oooooh oooh ooh oh?
Will it feel like aaah ah ah ah?
Does she tell you what she wants?
Can you give her what she needs?

Youth don’t leave me
Hair stay on me
God I love those hips
Oh memory don’t forsake me
Not like this

All those pretty things
Don’t sweat the pretty things
So collectable
Why not collect them all?
Obviously cunningly womanly
All those pretty things
God bless the pretty things

All those pretty things
Don’t sweat the pretty things
So collectable
Why not collect them all?
Obviously cunningly womanly
All those pretty things
God bless the pretty things.

Pop,"Silent night, holy night!
All is calm, All is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy Infant so Tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight!
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Al-le-lu-ia!
Christ the Saviour is born!
Christ the Saviour is born!

Silent night, holy night!
Wondrous star, lend thy light!
With the angels let us sing
Alleluia to our King!
Christ the Saviour is here
Jesus the Saviour is here!

Silent night, Holy night!
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Jesus Lord at thy birth"
Pop,"It's been said and done
Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now here's another one
So your melody will play on and on with the best of 'em
You are beautiful like a dream come alive, incredible
A centerfold miracle, lyrical
You saved my life again
And I want you to know, baby

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hittin' repeat, peat, peat, peat, peat

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hittin' repeat, peat, peat, peat, peat

Constantly, boy, you play through
My mind like a symphony
There's no way to describe what you do to me
You just do to me what you do
And it feels like I've been rescued

I've been set free
I am hypnotized by your destiny
You are magical, lyrical, beautiful, you are
And I want you to know, baby

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hittin' repeat, peat, peat, peat, peat

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hittin' repeat, peat, peat, peat, peat

No one compares, you stand alone
To every record I own
Music to my heart that's what you are
A song that goes on and on

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hittin' repeat, peat, peat, peat, peat

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I love you like a love song"

Baby I'm down to what you want
But there's some conditions you'll have to follow
You know that I'm not afraid to party
So do you wanna have some fun
You're gonna have to get to know me better
Let's go where the music's pumpin'
That's where I want to be
Don't think about anything else boy
I'm feein' right so just vibe with me tonight

Chorus:
Cuz it's all about feeling good
You've got to free your mind
It's feels so good when the music hits ya
It's all about feeling good
You've got to ease your mind
Baby get into it, cuz it feels so right

I'm hip to the way, the way we get along
I never thought you had it in ya, you're trying to turn me out
Now you think you're all that baby, let me show you how
How you do it, I know I can hold my own

Pop,"It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh

Yeah, we're happy, free
Confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, uh uh

I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, 22

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh
(Who's Taylor Swift anyway?)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping

Yeah, we're happy, free
Confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh oh

I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're

I don't know about you
22, 22

It feels like one of those nights, we ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights, we won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights, you look like bad news
I gotta have you, I gotta have you

Ooh yeah

I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're

Dancing like

It feels like one of those nights, we won't be sleeping

Pop,"Loving you madly will be forever
I see the ocean in your eyes when we're together
There are no boundaries, there are no limits
My heart has been embraced now that you're in it

Hold me closer to your dreams
Closer to your fears
Close to hear your laughter
Hold me when you're close to tears

Time passes by seconds into minutes
Every field and flower fades but love is infinite
There are no boundaries, there are no limits
My heart's a bigger place now that you're in it

Hold me closer to your dreams
Closer to your fears
Close to hear your laughter
Hold me when you're close to tears
I wanna be the one (be the one)
You tell your secrets to
All I want is to be closer (closer)
Closer (closer) to you

How long can we stay awake?
How hard can we laugh?
How much love can we make?

Can't get with me

Saw you at
The corner store
Now you want it like it was before
You never meant
To act that way
Decided for playin' all your games
I want you to
Get one thing straight
Not fallin' fallin' fallin' for what you say
I'll never be
Your fool again
I'm tellin' you boy this is the end

Sorry baby you're all done (Sorry baby you're all done)
Got to give up on me and move on (Give up on me and move on)

Pop,"Riprock,AG
Come in, over
Yo, turn me up
I wanna be heard
See I'm talkin' about the future ya'll
And the future looks bright
'specially when we rip it in half

Here it comes (Millennium)
And everybody's talkin 'bout Jerusalem
Is this the beginning or beginning of the end
Well, I've got other thoughts my friend

See I've got my eyes on the skies
The heavenly bodies up high
And if you're in the mood to take a ride
The strap on a suit and get inside

Chorus

If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby
If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby
Why-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yay
Whi-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yo

We don't need all these prophecies
Tellin' us what's a sign, what's a sign
'Cause paranoia ain't the way to live your life from day to day
So leave your doubts and fears behind

Don't be afraid at all
'Cause up in outer space there's no gravity to fall
Put your mind and body to the test
'Cause up in outer space it's like the wild wild west

Chorus-repeat

Boom and never let you try and stop me
Born to fly sky high, up to the top see
Nothing to fear, no doubts and no tears
Millennium sound to motivate the future years
And you can either be scared or get prepared
Against all odds I bet you never would've dared
To make these moves and take a flight like me
To come through for the world prophecy
Space connect to overthrow your interception,
Ready or not, make it hot
That ain't no question
Get *NSYNC and put your head to the sky
Keep the faith
One love from Left Eye (Left Eye)

Pop,"Originally recorded by The Spinners in 1973. The song was
Written by Thom Bell and Phil Hurtt.


This, is our fork in the road
Love's last episode
There's nowhere to go, oh no

You made your choice, now it's up to me
To bow out gracefully
Though you hold the key, but baby

Whenever you call me, I'll be there
Whenever you want me, I'll be there
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
I'll be around

I, knew just what to say
Now I found out today
That all the words had slipped away, but I know

There's always a chance
A tiny spark remains, yeah
And sparks turn into flames
And love can burn once again, but I know you know

Whenever you call me, I'll be there
Whenever you want me, I'll be there
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
I'll be around...yeah

Whenever you call me, I'll be there
Whenever you want me, I'll be there
Even if I have to call, I'll be there
I'll be around

Just call me at home, I'll be there
I'll never leave you alone, I'll be there
Just call out your name you know I know you know
I'll be around
"
Pop,"People say it doesn’t exist
’cause no one would like to admit
That there is a city underground
people who live everyday
Off the waste and decay
Off the discards of their fellow man
Here in subcity life is hard
We can’t receive any government relief
I’d like to please give mr president my honest regards
For disregarding me

They say there’s too much crime in these city streets
My sentiments exactly
Government and big business hold the purse strings
When I worked I worked in the factories
I’m at the mercy of the world
I guess I’m lucky to be alive

They say we’ve fallen through the cracks
They say the system works
But we won’t let it
Help
I guess they never stop to think
We might not just want handouts
But a way to make an honest living
Living this ain’t living

What did I do deserve this
Had my trust in god
Worked everyday of my life
Thought I had some guarantees
That’s what I thought
At least that’s what I thought

Last night I had another restless sleep
Wondering what tomorrow might bring
Last night I dreamed
A cold blue light was shining down on me
I screamed myself awake
Thought I must be dying
Thought I must be dying"
Pop,"My guiding angel (angel)
Up above (angel)
I have lost (angel)
My first love (angel)

So lonely and blue

Too many teardrops (angel)
Do I cry (angel)
Since we said (angel)
It's goodbye (angel)
My guiding angel (angel)
Now what must I do?
Oh I wonder (wonder) , I wonder (wonder)
Does he miss me too?

Who can replace
His tender embrace?

Understand (angel)

Like oh, caught up in the mix
Oh, yeah you got me losing it night by night
I said oh, I really know I shouldn't
But oh, I never feel like this
Oh, can't believe I'm doing this night by night

My world keeps spinning
Got double vision and vertigo
I love the feeling
Night by night

And for the first time I can't let go
I would give it up but I love it all
I was innocent but I know, know, know
I'm going down the rabbit hole
And for the first time I got too close
I would stay away but I love it all
I was innocent but I know, know, know
I'm going down the rabbit hole

I said oh, dancing in the moonlight
Oh, forever on a trip
Oh, yeah you got me losing it
Night by night
I said oh, wish upon a star
Like oh, I hope this never ends
Oh, can't believe I'm doing this
Night by night

My world keeps spinning
Got double vision and vertigo
I love the feeling
Night by night

And for the first time I can't let go
I would give it up but I love it all

I'm going down the rabbit hole

Down the rabbit hole
I'm going, I'm going
I'm going down
I'm going down the rabbit hole
I'm going, I'm going

Pop,"[Chorus:]
Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'ma light one up

[Verse 1:]

Pocket full of papers so I'm finnin to get some papers (yeah)

So get the leaves and trees like it's autumn
Have them windows all rolled up rolled em and told em man

Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'ma light one up
Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt
Every time I breathe it's like I'm taking a puff, turn the music high
Roll the windows up, when I smoke and drive

[Verse 2:]
First of all til you ball like this
You don't put this type of pimp in your swish
Get it we smoking on that poison call it Michael Bivins
So if you selling to me then you gotta lucrative business
A friend is what you blow while I'm smoking on that CEO
Top notch I got foot by the foot in my fruit roll up
No cuts no stems no seeds straight THC indeed
I'm tryna get stoned like I'm staring into Medusa eyes
You ain't got green what somebody tell me who supply
So I can buy wholesale for the low like Cosco or Sams
You got some well damn

Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'ma light one up
Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt

[Verse 3:]
I don't smoke phillies pass me and swisher
Bumping PMC pouring out a little liquor
Trunk full of kicker blunt full of OG
Right behind tint cuz these jack boys know me
Smokin' sour diesel out of NYC
Keisha calling ATL oh well I'm kushin DC
Which ones better roll up I need a time
Take a ride downtown man I'm higher than these skyscapers
Roll the windows up tryna get my smoke on

This little girl didn't care what anybody said
She got the whole world dancing to the music in her head
They love to trush her, bad, laugh at her and call her names
oh yeah
And now they all try to copy her isn't that a shame
yeah, it all just made her stronger

Don't stop, stop the music
The world will keep turning if you use it
Get up there and Don't stop, stop the music
People keep dancing
you can do it
Baby come on
Yeah baby come on

He knew that he was different
This luck he couldn't win
They didn't dig his vision
They tried to fit him in
But there's no room for loosers
Until they make you change
And then you love them
Tell me how much longer

Don't stop, stop the music
The world will keep turning if you use it
Get up there and Don't stop, stop the music
People keep dancing

If you just keep on dancing
Then you will feel no pain
Baby it's your Decision
Only you can break the chain
Yeah
So all you gotta do is dance
come on

Music like love
floating in the air
you can reach out
grab it everywhere
showing you your special
God put it on earth
to make it all
make it worth living
while the worlds still spinning

Don't stop, stop the music
The world will keep turning if you use it
Get up there and Don't stop, stop the music
People keep dancing

"
Pop,"There's an eclipse in your eye
where I used to shine
Every secret untold
is a planet aligned
Don't need prophets or preachers
to make sense of the signs
When the buried and hidden can
be seen by the blind

You're right
Some words are just unspoken
So right
Then it all just falls apart

The day I break your heart

I caught my reflection
in the corner of your eye
You said ""Don't even ask the question,
and I won't tell the lie""
Where there's no accusation
there's no need for denial
And if you hadn't heard that whisper
there'd be no tear to
wipe from your eye

You're right
Some words are best unspoken
So right
Then it all just falls apart

The day I break your heart

Never took no advice
Not the foolish, not the wise
All the truth that I needed
was right there in your smile
Every prophecy written of
what's going to be
All beginnings and
endings, they're about
you and me

You're right
Some words are best unspoken
So right
Until it all just falls apart
You´re right
Some words are best unspoken
So right
Then it all just falls apart

The day I break your heart"
Pop,"Hey, you give me bed head
You give me bed head, yeah

Some call it magic
And I don't know how (I don't know how)
But I know that I have it (know that I have it)
And it all works out (and it all works out)

I've got my family and my friends with me
They the only ones who knows my secret (some call it magic,
magic)
Trynna find a way bring it out and say
That you know you're special and believe it"
Pop,"Driving home in my car, nearly midnight
Rain on the road in my view
Holding my heart, it’s the first night without you
On my clothes I still smell your perfume

Should have called
When I left you were crying
Is it too late to apologise
From talking to fighting, admitting, denying
To finally saying goodbye

Now I regret every word that was spoken
I said some things you know I didn’t mean
Maybe we’ll turn back the time
Work it out, start anew
Oh maybe today I’ve lost you

I can’t help but think of our last conversation
I close my eyes I can still see your face
I hope what I’m feeling now
You are feeling it too
Oh maybe today I’ve lost you

Driving faster out on this empty road
Being single’s so bad at twenty-three
Looking for signs, asking strangers directions
When the answer’s right in front of me

Strange how a minute can feel like a lifetime
I know what I had now it’s gone
I swallowed my pride coz alone here, I’m dying
And with you is where I belong

For twenty-four hours I’ve been searching for reasons
Reasons why we should be living apart
Hope I’m not too late to come home
Work it out, start anew
Oh maybe today I’ve lost you

Baby today, I’ve lost you
Baby today, I’ve lost you"
Pop,"Oh it really wasn't my intention
To disregard convention
It was just an impulse that had to be obeyed

Though it seems convention we've been scorning
I'll still not go in warning
Though my reputation is blemished, I'm afraid

With just one kiss
What heaven, what rapture, what bliss!

Honestly, I thought I wouldn't
Naturally, I thought I couldn't
And probably I shouldn't
But aren't you kinda glad we did?

Actually, it all was blameless
Never the less, they'll call it shameless
So let's keep the lady nameless
But aren't you kinda glad we did?

Socially, I'll be an outcast
Obviously, we'll dine alone
On my good name there will be doubt cast
With never a sign of any chaperone

No matter how they may construe it
Whether or not we have to ruin
Whatever made us do it
Well aren't you kinda glad we did?

Aren't you kinda glad we did?
"
Pop,"Oh no we’re turning into cannibals
And everything that she wants is made out of minerals
I don’t know what I’ve done she only speaks in subliminals
The reception here is lousy and the service is minimal
Oh no I live with an eskimo
I swallow cos we’ve become mechanical and hollow
I seem to make you miserable
So take your tiny chemicals cos I need a miracle
Free your soul to me
Meet me on the corner cos the wall's on fire
Words can set us free
Can you make it go away
Make it stop, stop

Wait, there’s something that I wanna say
Something that we hid away
Something that I’d like to change
These words have never left the mouth
We never got to get it out
Communication not allowed
Some things we don’t talk about

Oh no I’ve fallen off a pedestal
And your selective memory is really quite incredible
Tomorrow when you get forgettable
I’ll try being wonderful yet totally inedible
Free your soul to me
Meet me there in China ’cross the wall of fire
Words can set us free
Can you make it go away
Make it stop, stop

Wait, there’s something that I wanna say
Something that we hid away
Something that I’d like to change
These words have never left the mouth
We never got to get it out
Communication not allowed
Some things we don’t talk about

Free your soul to me
Words can set us free
Can you make it go away
Make it stop, stop

Wait, there’s something that I wanna say
There’s something that we hid away
Something that I’d like to change
These words have never left the mouth
We never got to get it out
Communication not allowed
Some things we don’t talk about
Wait, there’s something that I wanna say
There’s something that we hid away
Something that I’d like to change
These words have never left the mouth
We never got to get it out
Communication not allowed
Some things we don’t talk about

Pop,"Ho, ho, ho, oh, little train, my little elf, another great Christmas.
Ah, man, it's boring, it's boring, same thing every year,
so let's have a funky Christmas!

Have a funky funky Christmas, have a funky funky Christmas.
New Kids On The Block, let's rock, it's Christmas time.
We're gonna celebrate it with a rhyme.
Danny D, are you ready? - Ready as I'll ever be
Steady - you know, Joey Joe is ready
Jordan and Jon, yeah, come on, we got a funky, funky Christmas going on.

Have a funky...
Funky Christmas and a funky new year, I swear we got ourselves a party here
Girls on the floor knows our posse at the door
Should I stop - nah cool - here's more of this song, a funky Christmas melody
'cause Jordan K feels so Christmasy
Throw your hands in the air pause, kick the ballistics Santa Claus

Have a funky...
Sneaking downstairs on Christmas Eve
I saw a sight that you just wouldn't believe
St. Nick by the fireplace dusting off his head with a frown on his face
He said hay - said what - he said you - I said what
He said you left the fire burning and I burnt my butt
so now I've learned you've got to turn the fireplace down
so Santa won't get burned

Have a funky...

Have a funky...
Slipping and sliding through the city streets
I'll be in town getting down to the Christmas beat
it's Danny D I'm here with Christmas cheer
no feeling to end the party of the year
it's going I'm showing fresh rhymes I'm throwing
it's snowing outside but we ho-ho-hoing
Santa's on the way, sleigh bells are ringing, swinging, everybody start singing

Have a funky....

It's Christmas, can you swing this?
Funky, dope jam top on your Christmas list, do you dig this?
Boy, there ain't no twist, just something you wish for and you almost missed huh
Funky Christmas and a Happy New Year, how could you be booing it
with Donnie D doing it?

Have a funky....

Ho, ho, ho, this is the MC Santa Claus and my elf little Joe
Yeah, merry Christmas, merry Christmas, we gonna kick the ballistics"
Pop,"You got
What most dames want
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
But it ain't
What I came to see
(Uh, huh, I know)
You don't know
Bout my game zone
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Time to show
This boy a harder me

Ay
You talking
Like you know what I
Want
Before you
Start pursuing baby
Whoa
You run girl
Like a track star
But I'm more
Like a Nascar
Blowin it back at ya
Please
I knew
I wasn't talkin
From the door
We were gonna kiss
Make my hair twist
Have me lookin crazy
No
This is obviously
This is your thing right
Trickin' girls to think
Their the only ones
You're feelin right

Stupid
Stupid I'm not
I've been
Around here baby
That means I'm on it
And I'm used
To sucker boys like you
Stupid
Stupid I'm not
You talk about it baby
But when it comes
To a real girl wants
You just don't know
What to do

You think you know
But you don't
(You just don't know
what to do)
You think you know
But you don't
(You just don't know

You think you know
But you don't
(You just don't know

You think you know

Hey
You told my girl
That I'm with you
Whoa

Veronica had shown
The message
That you sent sayin'
He wanted
To be her man
And I was never
In your plans
Please
I told you
You ain't nothing I
Want
So why
You keep blowin' up
My phone
You stuntin'
And you poppin' right
Do us both a favor
And stop callin'
On a late night

(Chorus)

Shorty I can change
Your whole life in a day
I don't even think
You know
I can do the things
Them other boys
Ccan't hang
I'm everything you want
Come on flip the page
Let me show you
They can't tame me
I can be you baby
So tell me why
You actin so shady
Cause you know damn
Well you want
To be my lady

(Chorus)"
Pop,"Watch me take it up, then I break it down
I don't play sports, but it's a touchdown
I don't blend in, I-I'm a black sheep
And even then, ha, they still follow me
I rock the race stripes, go, go and check my closet
Never share the guap, go and check my wallet
I'm a comet, out of this planet
Sitting on the throne, and these haters can't stand it

DJ play my song on the radio
Lifts me up when I'm feeling low
Drop the beat and play it again
Play it again yeah
DJ spin it back
If you feeling me
The 808 track is all I need
Drop the beat and play it again
Play it again yeah

Now watch me do my thing
Do my thing out on the stage
I become an animal, go and put me in a cage
I'm a beast, I'm a beast
Why they let me off my leash
No you can't tame me, in this jungle of concrete
I'm a creature, I ain't lying
Not a cheater, I'm a lioness
They saying I'm the best
And I ain't drop an album yet
I got them waiting
Anticipating
They losing patience
My music is vaccination for all my loyal patients

DJ play my song on the radio
Lifts me up when I'm feeling low
Drop the beat and play it again
Play it again yeah
DJ spin it back
If you feeling me
The 808 track is all I need
Drop the beat and play it again
Play it again yeah

Light
Silver moon, moon light
Let the boom, boom play
Turn it up till you feel the pace
Rock
Never gon, gon stop
Say whatcha wan, wan say

DJ play my song on the radio
Lifts me up when I'm feeling low
Drop the beat and play it again

Pop,"See the way he walks down the street
Watch the way he shuffles his feet
My, he holds his head up high
When he goes walking by
He's my guy

When he holds my hand I'm so proud
'Cause he's not just one of the crowd
My baby, oh he's the one
To try the things they've never done
Just because of that they say

CHORUS
He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good
He's a rebel and he'll never ever be understood
And just because he doesn't do what everybody else does
That's no reason why I can't give him all my love
He is always good to me, always treats me tenderly
'Cause he's not a rebel, no no no
He's not a rebel, no no no, to me

INSTRUMENTAL

If they don't like him that way, they won't like me after today
I'll be standing right by his side, when they say

CHORUS
He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good
He's a rebel 'cause he never ever does what he should
And just because he doesn't do what everybody else does
That's no reason why we can't share a love
He is always good to me, good to him I'll try to be
'Cause he's not a rebel, no no no
He's not a rebel, no no no, to me
(He's not a rebel, no no no
He's not a rebel, no no no
He's not a rebel, no no no
He's not a rebel, no no no)"

Pop,"May your heart be never alonewhen
the dawn’s breaking
May your life be a rolling stonewhen
the ground starts shaking
And the world is waking
All I can tell you is to know who you are
And if they hurt you they can never do you harm
And if you want to you can love ‘emtill
the cold turns warm
May your kiss always feel like the first kisses
And may your truth help you heal
May you catch big fishes and get all your wishes
All I can tell you is to know who you are...
If you want me (I will be there)
If you need me (I will be there)
If you want me (I will be there)
Can you hear me?
If you’re waiting (I will be there)
Your heart’s aching (I will be there)
If you need me (I will be there)
Can you hear me?
And when you’re lonely (I will be there)
When you call me (I will be there)
If you need me (I will be there)
Believe me I’m going nowhere
May your heart be never alone."
Pop,"You Will See

I'm caught up in a mystery way
I'm in a constant distant state
I pray for this to always be
The path that has been chosen for me
Cos it's got me spinning round and round, round and round
So high I can't touch the ground anymore
And it's all that I'm praying

So let it rain, let it pour, call me names it won't phase me
I don't care what they say
No denouncement could change me
Cos it's only a matter of time 'til it finds you
Try to run for your life, you'll still feel it behind you
You will see
You will, you will see
You will, you will see

Everybody starts with a clean slate
Only altered by unnecessary hate
I pray that I will never be
Affected by how you portray me
Cos it's got me spinning round and round, round and round
But I'm not scared of being down any more
Now there's no one controlling me

So let it rain, let it pour, call me names it won't phase me
I don't care what they say
No denouncement could change me
Cos it's only a matter of time 'til it finds you
Try to run for your life, you'll still feel it behind you
You will see
You will, you will see
You will see
You will, you will see

(let ir rain) I'm not a slave to your attention
(let it pour) Fuck your lies I'll never be a victim
(let it rain) I Fell from the sky, a perfect landing
(let it pour) Sheltered from the storm and all the rain
You will see

So let it rain, let it pour, call me names it won't phase me
I don't care what they say
No denouncement could change me
Cos it's only a matter of time 'til it finds you
Try to run for your life, you'll still feel it behind you
Let it rain, let it pour, call me names it won't phase me
I don't care what they say
No denouncement could change me
Cos it's only a matter of time 'til it finds you
Try to run for your life, you'll still feel it behind you

Pop,"Isn't funny how some people
never practice what the preach
Isn't it sad that the strongest arms
still to short to reach
I watch him struggle with the fact that
his become what he said he'll never be
Hip parties and sunglasses at night
thay help him not to see
can he see

That he's been high on a young girls ride
never lone on a saturday night
He's been a around the world about a million times
But he's never been love
not on the inside

Isn't so messed up to be withness for a man who won't confess
he won't confess, no
That he lost his truth
so god help him believe in his own prayers
I watch him struggle with the fact that
he relies on people that don't really care, the don't care, no no no
You say that the buisness is a whack
so baby why are you so deep in there

He's been high on a young girls ride
never alone on a saturday night
he's been a around the world about a million times
but he's never been love
not on the inside

One day it's gonna be to late
or maybe it's to late anyway
Famous has made you shameless
but not blameless
just loveless, loveless, loveless

He's been high on a young girls ride
never alone on a saturday night
he's been a around the world about a million times
but he's never been love
not on the inside

he's been high on a young girls ride
never alone on a saturday night
he's been a around the world about a million times
but he's never been love
not on the inside"
Pop,"I remember years ago
someone told me I should take
caution when it comes to love
I did, I did
and you were strong and I was not
my illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did

and now, all is done
and there`s is nothing to say
you have gone and so effortlessly
you have won
you can go ahead tell them
tell them all I know now
shout it from the rooftops
write it on the sky line
all we had is gone now

tell them I was happy
and my heart is broken
all my scars are open
tell them what I hoped would be
impossible (impossible)
impossible (impossible)
impossible (impossible)
impossible

I remember years ago
someone told me I should take
caution when it comes to love
I did ,I did
tell them all I know now
shout it from the rooftops
write it on the sky line
all we had is gone now

tell them I was happy
and my heart is broken
all my scars are open
tell them what I hoped would be

Pop,"Brokenhearted
Unsatisfied
I can't help it I can't get you off my mind
She was so wrong
To treat you bad
She didn't know you were the best she'd ever had
If I were yours
And you were mine
I'd make sure that I could please you all the time

Chorus:
I'd be here waiting
I'd treat you right
If I were your girl
I'd keep up all night
Appreciate you
And so much more
That I would give you
If I were your girl

So frustrated
What do I do
I get excited when I'm standing next to you
Does she love you
Is she unkind
I don't know why you're there something isn't right
All the wonders
Of the world
Are the things that I would give if I were her

Chorus

I never felt this way inside
It's so hard, so very hard to hide
Cause I can see
That you don't receive
The things you deserve
I'd give you so much more
If I were your girl

"
Pop,"Calling all the girls
There's an SOS tonight, let's have some fun
One hundred percent
Every single chase somehow these days are gone, yeah

There's gonna be a million faces up in this room ooh
But the only one who gets my attention is you, you

I got my best on
And I feel like dancing all night long
Nothing's gonna stop me
Oh but I want
So baby come and get me
'Cause I don't wanna dance alone
Oh it's been so long
Thinking 'bout the feeling of your arms
Wrapped around my body
It's what I want
So baby come and get me
'Cause I don't wanna dance alone

And on the floor
I can feel you staring at me across the room, ooh
Whatcha waiting for
All I want is you so come and make a move

I see a million silver lights up in this room, ooh
I wanna be the one who gets the attention from you, oh

I got my best on
And I feel like dancing all night long
Nothing's gonna stop me
Oh but I want
So baby come and get me
'Cause I don't wanna dance alone
Oh it's been so long
Thinking 'bout the feeling of your arms
Wrapped around my body
It's what I want
So baby come and get me
'Cause I don't wanna dance alone

If you come in close
Babe I won't say no
Baby all I want is you
If you move too slow
Then you'll never know
All the things that we could do

If you come in close
Babe I won't say no
Baby all I want is you
If you move too slow
Then you'll never know
All the things that we could do

I got my best on
And I feel like dancing all night long
Nothing's gonna stop me
Oh but I want
So baby come and get me
'Cause I don't wanna dance alone
Oh it's been so long
Thinking 'bout the feeling of your arms
Wrapped around my body
It's what I want
So baby come and get me
'Cause I don't wanna dance alone

I don't wanna dance alone
I don't wanna dance alone"
Pop,"Head underwater, tumbling down further
Lord help me now, help me now
Fighting for myself
Cause nobody could help
I'm reaching out, reaching out

I was out for a minute
Caught my breath, I'm back in it
I was lost but I've found my feet
Here I am

Took many punches to the ground
But I got up when I was down
Never been one to quit
I found strength within my weakness
Sometimes I have nothing to say
But I won't be quiet not today
No giving up on this
I found strength within my weakness

Here I am, here I am
Here I am, here I am right now
Here I am, here I am
I found strength within my weakness

Shadows eat me up
But I'm no longer scared of the dark
I see the light, I see the light
They said I was too old
That out of the ember's hot and cold
But I'm on fire, I'm on fire

I was out for a minute
Caught my breath, I'm back in it
I was lost but I've found my feet
Here I am

Took many punches to the ground
But I got up when I was down
Never been one to quit
I found strength within my weakness
Sometimes I have nothing to say
But I won't be quiet not today
No giving up on this
I found strength within my weakness

Here I am, here I am
Here I am, here I am right now
Here I am, here I am
I found strength within my weakness
Here I am, here I am
Here I am, here I am right now
Here I am, here I am
I found strength within my weakness

I was out for a minute
Caught my breath, I'm back in it
I was lost but I've found my feet
Here I am

Took many punches to the ground
But I got up when I was down
Never been one to quit
I found strength within my weakness
Sometimes I have nothing to say
But I won't be quiet not today
No giving up on this
I found strength within my weakness

Here I am, here I am
Here I am, here I am right now
Here I am, here I am
I found strength within my weakness
Here I am, here I am
Here I am, here I am right now
Here I am, here I am
I found strength within my weakness"
Pop,"She sits alone on a roof
for the third time this week
as she's shivering
she can't really speak
And she says
Is there someone out there for me

Cuz I'm waiting here so patiently
Do you know what it's like on your own
when there's nobody home
watch the sunset all alone
Do you know what it's like to sing a song
all the notes come out wrong
and you wish to youself
that someone comes around
but no one comes around
Another lonely night
she knows how this story ends
trying not to care
but she just cant pretend

And lately she's been lost
Searching for someone
and she asks herself where did i go wrong?
where did i go wrong?
Do you know what it's like on your own
when there's nobody home
watch the sunset all alone

Do you know what it's like to sing a song
all the notes come out wrong
and you wish to youself
that someone comes around
but no one comes around
When five hours have past
and she knows hes not calling back

And it's breaking her down
its breaking her down
but she knows that somones gotta come around
Sunday night, she's sitting on her roof at home
Doesn't wanna watch another sunset all alone
Do you know what it's like on your own
when there's nobody home
watch the sunset all alone

Do you know what it's like to sing a song
all the notes come out wrong
and you wish to youself
that someone comes around
but no one comes around"
Pop,"Day through my window
Sunlight's breaking through my eyes
I'm still sleeping
Dreaming for the band to play

I can hear it,yeah
I can feel it in my soul
Like a rocket
In the sky

Chorus:
It's a beautiful morning(a beautiful day)
It's beautiful place for us to start
A beautiful morning(a beautiful day)
A beautiful way to loose your heart

Time files
The sun shines
Behind me forgiveness everywhere
I am breathing believing
The love is always there

Can you feel it?,yeah
Can you feel it in the air?
Like a rocket
I'm so high

Chorus

Just the day to take it easy on yourself
My friend(my friend)
Just the day to say I think of no one else but you
(but you)

Oh,can you feel it?yeah
Can you feel it touching down?
Like a rocket
On the moon

It's a beautiful morning
A beautiful place for us to start
A beautiful morning
A beautiful way to loose your heart

Chorus

What a beautiful beautiful morning
What a beautiful beautiful day
What a beautiful beautiful morning,yeah"
Pop,"You've seen my face
Hey don't you know my name
It wasn't all that long ago i had my fifteen minutes of fame
If it was you caught in a crazy game
Would you still look as good standing in the rain

Whatever gets you through the night
Take it from me -- it's gonna be alright

Been there done that
Been there -- then somebody takes you back
Been there done that
So hard hard to avoid the trap

They break your heart -- why do we let them in
The drug is strong but the will is weak
We make the same mistakes again
There comes a time we all gotta rise above
Look inside and redefine just what it is we want from love

Been there done that
Been there -- still working my way back
Been there done that
So hard hard to avoid the trap

And when you feel strong enough to face up to it
You're gonna do just fine"
Pop,"Oh there are people here
So many people here looking back at me
Feel the energy
Oh they call my name
Oh they call my name it's the loudest noise
And it's all for me

Yeah it's all for me
Yeah when it's all for me
I can get away to a better place
Hey I'm looking down
Yeah I'm looking down
I can see you now
Are you coming out

There's a voice in my head
And it's talking again
Out of time, out of space
It's a feeling a meaning that I can taste

I don't know what people see but I like it (I like it)
I like it (I like it)
I don't know why people give but I'll take it (I'll take it)
I'll take it (I'll take it)

(Hey!)

Hey, I'm back again
Yeah I'm back again in another place
I can see your face
Oh let me hear you now, yeah let me hear you now
Let me hear you loud, make a bigger sound

There's a voice in my ear
The intention is clear
Out of time, out of space
It's a feeling a meaning that I can taste

I don't know what people see but I like it (I like it)
I like it (I like it)
I don't know why people give but I'll take it (I'll take it)
I'll take it (I'll take it)

Everybody's looking for
Someone that they can adore
Give them what they came here for
Always leave them wanting more

I don't know what people see but I like it (I like it)
I like it (I like it)
I don't know why people give but I'll take it (I'll take it)
I'll take it (I'll take it)

I don't know what people see but I like it (I like it)
I like it (I like it)
I don't know why people give but I'll take it (I'll take it)
I'll take it (I'll take it"
Pop,"They're tryin' to take away my pride
By stripping me of everyhing I own
They're tryin' to hurt me inside
And make me into a white man's drone


But this one's not for sale
And I was born to fight
I ain't been knocked down yet
I was born to fight
I'm the surest bet


There ain't no man no woman
No beast alive that can beat me
'Cause I'm born to fight
They're tryin' to dig into my soul
And take away the spirit of my god
They're tryin' to take control
And monitor my every thought

I won't let down my guard
And I was born to fight
I ain't been knocked down yet
I was born to fight
I'm the surest bet


There ain't no man no woman
No beast alive that can beat me
'Cause I'm born to fight"
Pop,"Umum
Some people live their lives by the book
Some people are too scared to even look
Some people don't even really care
Noo
I'm not a woman yet still not a child
So what am I suppose to do with my life
It doesn't fit me anymore
Right now
Not yet
(Chorus)

When too many of us has forgot
What our lives is all about
Ah yeah
But your heart will never grow old
Care too much about what other people say

And your mind will never ever get bigger if you remember how to play
Some people never asked themselves why
Some people seek other's extreme too scared of their own inner hive
No, No
I will never try to hide behind myself
I will never try to be somebody else
It wouldn't do me any good
Right now

Not yet

(Chorus)
Say yeah
Say yeah
Yeah
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Say yeah
(Chorus)

Say

Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you remember how to play
Yeahyeahyeahyeah"
Pop,"sometimes i go walkin through fields
where we walked
long ago in the sweet used-to-be
and the flowers still grow
but they don't smell as sweet
as they did when you picked them for me
and when i think of you
and the love we once knew
how i wish we could go back in time
do you ever think back on old mem'ries like that
or do i ever cross your mind

(chours)
do you ever wake up lonely
in the middle of the night
because you miss me,do you darlin
oh and do your mem'ries ever take you back
into another place and time
and do you ever miss the feelings and the love
we shared when you were with me,do you darlin
i just wonder do i ever cross your mind

oh how often i wish that again i could kiss
your sweet lips like i did long ago
how often i long for those two lovin arms
that once held me so gentle and so close

and when i think of you and the love we once knew
how i wish we could go back in time
do you ever recall these old mem'ries at all
or do i ever cross your mind

(repeat chours)
"
Pop,"Do you have a moment?
Boy we need a talk
It's a conversation that's been coming on, oh
Why you want me living like I'm in a cage?
I'm just tired of hoping that you're gonna change, oh

I'm just out here baby living my life
I just have to say you got no right

You're so sensitive baby
And I love it about you
But you're driving me crazy
'Cause you're jealous in love
You're so sensitive baby
And I don't wanna hurt you but I'm moving on
Yeah I'm moving on

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, baby

Boy you better man up, go and dry your tears
Don't know where I'm going but I can't stay here
You can find a new love, she can be the kind
That'll let you keep her right there by your side

I'm just out here baby living my life
I just have to say you got no right

You're so sensitive baby
And I love it about you
But you're driving me crazy
'Cause your jealous in love
You're so sensitive baby
And I don't wanna hurt you but I'm moving on
Yeah I'm moving on

No question, you complete me
But two empty halves make for one empty hole
In the pit of my stomach and in the pit of my soul

I'm just out here baby living my life
I just have to say you got no right

You're so sensitive baby
And I love it about you
But you're driving me crazy
'Cause your jealous in love
You're so sensitive baby
And I don't wanna hurt you but I'm moving on
Yeah I'm moving on

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby I'm movin'"
Pop,"Mother of us all
Place of our birth
How can we stand aside
And watch the rape of the wold
This the beginning of the end
This the most heinous of crimes
This the deadliest of sins
The greatest violation of all time
Mother of us all
Place of our birth
We all are witness
To the rape of the world

You've seen her stripped mined
You've heard of bombs exploded underground
You know the sun shines
Hotter than ever before
Mother of us all
Place of our birth
We all are witness
To the rape of the world

Some claim to have crowned her
A queen
With cities of concrete and steel
But there is no glory no honor
In what results
From the rape of the world
Mother of us all
Place of our birth
We all are witness
To the rape of the world

She has been clear-cut
She has been dumped on
She has been poisoned and beaten up
And we have been witness
To the rape of the world
Mother of us all
Place of our birth
How can we stand aside
And watch the rape of the world

If you look you'll see it with your own eyes
If you listen you will hear her cries
If you care you will stand and testify
And stop the rape of the world
Stop the rape of the world
Mother of us all
Mother of us all
Mother of us all
Mother of us all"
Pop,"I don't need money, I don't need gold,
your sweet kiss is wealth untold.
I don't need the sunshine in the sky,
there is sunshine in your eyes.
When you hold me oh so near,
nothing more can matter, dear.
Oh, all I need is you.

When I'm lost in your embrace,
the world becomes a magic place.
When you hold me, church bells ring,
when I kiss you, angels sing.
Can't you see I love you so,
say you'll never let me go.
Oh, all I need is you.

Oh darling please believe me,
my love is not a lie,
for if you ever leave me,
then I would die.

Hold me tight and hold me fast,
say your love will always last.
Darling never set me free,
please don't take your love from me.
What's the sky without the moon above,
what am I without your love.
Oh, all I need is you."
Pop,"Only You Know And I Know
by Dave Mason
Performed by Joan Osborne

Only you know and I know
All the loving we've got to show
So don't refuse to believe it
By reading too many meanings

'Cause you know that I mean what I say so don't go
And never take me the wrong way
You know you can't go on getting your own way
'Cause if you do, it's gonna get you someday, yeah.

We're both here to be pleasing
Oh no, not deceiving
But it's hard to believe in, aw yeah
When you've been so mistreated.

'Cause you know that I mean what I say so don't go
And never take me the wrong way
You know you can't go on getting your own way
'Cause if you do, it's gonna get you someday.

If I seem to mislead you
It's just my craziness coming through
But when it comes down to just two
Aw, I ain't no crazier than you

'Cause you know that I mean what I say so don't go
And never take me the wrong way
You know you can't go on getting your own way
'Cause if you do, it's gonna get you someday.

Only you know and I know
Only you know and I know
Only you know and I know, oh yeah
Only you know and I know, oh yeah, get up
"
Pop,"Weeks on end, I'm on the road
I start to lose my sense of home
I should've called so many times
But I, I just sat next to my phone

Just know it takes it for me
To end this darling, oh

And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go

Thinking back to every night
That we just laid there for a while
And when I looked into your eyes
I never thought I'd say goodbye

Just know it takes it from me
To end this darling, oh

And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go

Just needed time to, to find my own
But I promise someone will give you all you want
Can give you all you need
And you just gotta see
I never meant to hurt you, no

And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go"
Pop,"Do da do da do
Do da do da do
Do da do da do
Do da do da do

You're telling me,
That i don't look the same as i used to
Could it be
That times the only blame for our issues

I wanna know
Can't go no longer being neglected
Knowing that your heart has changed

Reminiscing of the times
Looking at the photos
Oh we were so happy then

Taking walks out in the park
Enjoying the sun
And i was your only one
And we were like closest friends

Back when,
We used to talk about anything
Now it seems you're not listening
When the nights are colder than usual
And summertime its just not the same
What happened to the love back when

Do da do da do
Do da do da do
Do da do da do
Do da do da do

You promised me
We'd plant the seeds of love and let it grow
And now it seems that you don't even wanna wait no more
'cause it seems,
The leaves done hit the ground and faded
Now the tree don't look the same

Reminiscing of the times
Looking at the photos
Oh we were so happy then

Taking walks out in the park
Enjoying the sun
And i was your only one
And we were like closest friends

Back when,
We used to talk about anything
Now it seems you're not listening
When the nights are colder than usual
And summertime its just not the same
What happened to the love back when

We used to talk about anything
Now it seems you're not listening
When the nights are colder than usual
And summertime its just not the same
What happened to the love back when

You told me that you love me
And now it seems to me were two
Strangers that's falling apart
And i know, nothing in life is guaranteed
So if you wanna move alone, then move along

Back when,
We used to talk about anything
Now it seems you're not listening
When the nights are colder than usual
And summertime its just not the same
What happened to the love back when

We used to talk about anything
Now it seems you're not listening
When the nights are colder than usual
And summertime its just not the same
What happened to the love back when"
Pop,"Been alone in here forever
Waiting in the dark
If you only knew me better
Open up your heart
Hey, every little thing I say
Every little thing I do
You should really know by now, baby
Every little thing I say
Every little thing I do
You should really know by now, it's for you!

Been waiting here forever
For you to come inside
Even though I never told you
God knows how I tried
Hey, every little thing I say
Every little thing I do
You should really know by now, baby
Every little thing I say
Every little thing I do
You should really know by now, it's for you!

Baby why you fought it
When you know I'm waiting
When you know I'm waiting here

Baby why you fought it
When you know I'm waiting
When you know I'm waiting here

Baby why you fought it
When you know I'm waiting
When you know I'm waiting here

Baby why you fought it
When you know I'm waiting
When you know I'm waiting here"
Pop,"I swore Iâ€™ll never get involved
Said Iâ€™ll never ever fall in love
Cause it hurt me once before,
Would it hurt me anymore ?
Since the time that I changed its different now
And the dust you and wondering off
I fell into your arms I was captured by your charms

Chorus
And here I goâ€¦
Falling in love again
Here I go
Falling in love again

Lost and scared as I can be
Get the winking of the mystery
Of the sharing of my first love
Like a pair of missness glove
Now you found your way into my world
Does the women think inside the girl
Can u tell me if its real
That have forgotten how to feel

Chorus

Iâ€™m falling in love again (2x)
Oh Iâ€™m falling in love again

Here I go falling in love again
That damages all that has already done
How can I ever tell my the on loving you
Here I go giving my all again
From ready to sew what I feel
So if you will take this loving to your heart

Now you found your way into my world
Does the women think inside the girl
Can you tell me how it feels
I forgotten how it feels
Here I go giving my all again
that damages already done
How can I ever tell on loving you
Here I go giving my all again
From ready to sew what I feel
So if you will take this loving to your arms

Ooh
Here I goâ€¦
Giving my heart again
Fallingâ€™ in love again
From the battle I just canâ€™t win
Here I goâ€¦
Ooh I need a loving again
Iâ€™ll be with you thin
Falling in love again (2x)
Iâ€™m falling in love again
Here I go here I goâ€¦
But you never need me falling
Here I goâ€¦â€¦â€¦
"
Pop,"If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me

You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause
You think you're cooler than me.

You got your hot crowd
Shoes on your feet
And you wear 'em around like it ain't shit
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise -- shh

See I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes
Just to feel seen
Behind your make-up
Nobody knows
Who you even know
Who do you think you are

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me.

You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear them around
Like you cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause
You think you're cooler than me.

You got your hot crowd
Switch in your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by,
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise -- shh

I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes
Just to feel seen
Behind your make-up
Nobody knows
Who you even know
Who do you think that you are

'Cos it's your scene
You got no doubt
We've all seen
You got your head in the club

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think your cooler than me.

You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear them around like you cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause
You think you're cooler than me."
Pop,"I get a feeling, I can't explain
Whenever your eyes meet mine
My heart spins in circles and I lose all space and time
And now that we're standing face to face
Something tells me, it's gonna be okay

And I'm ready to fall in love tonight
Ready to hold my heart open wide
I can't promise forever, but baby I'll try
Yes, I'm ready to fall in love tonight

I know you've been watching, choosing your moment
But I've been dreaming of that day
No one before you has gotten to me this way
And now that we're standing face to face
There's something that I need to say

I'm ready to fall in love tonight
Ready to hold my heart open wide
I can't promise forever but baby I'll try
Yes, I'm ready to fall in love tonight

Nothing is certain, this I know
Wherever we're headed, I'm ready to go

I can't promise forever but baby I'll try
Yes I'm ready to fall... in love tonight
Yes I'm ready to fall... in love tonight
Yes I'm ready to fall... in love tonight
"
Pop,"No, I never liked San Francisco
Never thought it was something special
Till you kissed me there
No, I never liked windy cities
But I think maybe when you're with me
I like everywhere

It's the strangest feeling
Midnight, I'm not leaving
Know for once, I think I'll stay
I'll say your name, just listen
Doesn't it sound difference
Never whispered it this way

It's gonna take me a minute
But I could get used to this
I feel it in your fingertips
The feeling of another kiss
It's gonna take me a minute
But I could get used to this
Like every tattoo on your skin
I'm memorizing every inch
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
Definitely

No, I never did like tequila
But there's something about when I see ya
I think I need a drink
And the callouses on your fingers
I admire them from a distance
Now they're on my cheek

Oh, I've known you forever
Now I know you better
Let's just get carried away, oh
And it bears repeating
How hard my heart's beating
When you tell me I should stay

It's gonna take me a minute
But I could get used to this
I feel it in your fingertips
The feeling of another kiss
It's gonna take me a minute
But I could get used to this
Like every tattoo on your skin
I'm memorizing every inch
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
Definitely

No, I never liked San Francisco
Never thought it was something special
Till you kissed me there

It's gonna take me a minute
But I could get used to this
I feel it in your fingertips
The feeling of another kiss
It's gonna take me a minute
But I could get used to this
Like every tattoo on your skin
I'm memorizing every inch
I could get used to this

I feel it all (I could get used to this)
You're kiss is all
I'll risk it all
Certain things are starting to fall
But we lost it all
And I just can't believe it all
Definitely"
Pop,"We think about the loves we lost
Will it come again
We think of all the things we want
Will we ever win

We listen to the voice of children
Will they find their way
Keep an open heart
The answer to it all's a wish away

Never let the tears you're cryin' blind you
To the dream that's waitin' to find you
'Cause there's one more chance
With every turn of the world

Is it gold or glory
A taste of freedom
Or the strong warm touch of a body
There are all these things with every turn of the world

Human kindness -- diamond of the heart
Tearing down the old walls
As long as we can share
Desire's not a sin, after all

When you find yourself alone
Missing tender magic touching you
Keep an open heart
Everything you dream can still be true

We all want a world we can live in
We all want a world full of love
It's never too late
It's never too soon
Whatever you can do is enough"
Pop,"NEVER YOURS

Say I have known some
Less than I should
Say I have known some
Too well for my own good
Say I'm a saint of mercy
Say I'm a whore
I've been a lot of things
But never yours

I wear my mama's dress
Her finest clothes
Daddy showed me outside
To meet you on the front porch
I laugh at all your jokes
But you look bored
I've been a lot of things but never yours

You never cross my mind
You can be sure
You'll never catch my eye
Waiting for you watching the door
I let you hold me
Dry lip kiss me on the dance hall floor
I've been a lot of things
But never yours

Never yours
Never yours
Never yours
Never yours
Never yours
Never yours
Never yours
Never yours

So you say you won
It was a bet
A game of pool or cards
I repay my family's debt
I let you lie beside me
With no remorse
I've been a lot of things
But never yours

Say I have known some
Less than I should
Say I have known some
Too well for my own good
Say I'm a saint of mercy
Say I'm a whore
I've been a lot of things
But never yours

Pop,"Came across a picture
Of you and her online
She looks at you like she knows
That you're bored out of your mind

I'm wrapped up in his arms
Feeling perfectly alone
But I know there's been a mix-up
'Cause I wish his hands were yours

So come closer, closer
Darling I thought of a plan
Let me whisper, whisper
So that you can understand
We'll be dressed in, dressed in
All black from head to toe

Only we'll know
Only we'll know

I think we should trade
cupid told me he was drunk that day
And so he shot two arrows the wrong way
I heard him say
I think we should trade, we'll tell 'em
Let's go on a double date
Meet us up at six in the cafe
We'll run away and call it the exchange

Blink twice if it's true
But do you think about it too?
You said you're running out with her
it tells me that you do

There's beats that I've been skippin'
When my head is own your chest
And you know if it were us two
It'd be cardiac arrest

So come closer, closer
Darling I thought of a plan
Let me whisper, whisper
So that you can understand
We'll be dressed in, dressed in
All black from head to toe

Only we'll know
Only we'll know

I think we should trade
cupid told me he was drunk that day
And so he shot two arrows the wrong way
I heard him say
Now that you know the truth
There is nothing like me and you
You can try and say it ain't true
But this doesn't mean how I look at you

Now that you know the truth
There is nothing like me and you
You can try and say it ain't true
But this doesn't mean how I look at you
Now that you know the truth
There is nothing like me and you
You can try and say it ain't true
But this doesn't mean how I look at you
But there's nothing like me and you

I think we should trade, we'll tell 'em
Let's go on a double date
Meet us up at six in the cafe
We'll run away
What do you say we run away
We'll call it the exchange"
Pop,"I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

But there's a side, to you, that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd said, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd played, you would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for ya…
Even now when we're already over
I can't tell myself from looking for ya

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, I felt something died,
'Cause I knew than that was the last time, the last time
Ooooh."
Pop,"I should have seen it coming
I should have f*cking known
How I could I let you play me
I don't even know
I should have seen it coming
I should have f*cking known
How I could I let you play me
I don't even know

I'm such a fool
I can't beleive I let you in my life
You broke the rules
But I should have known you'd do it all the time
Thought we were cool with everything
but who I'm kidding
It's every players favorite crime
To make you feel like it's all real
When it's a lie
And I should have known

I should have f*cking known
How I could I let you play me
I don't even know
I should have seen it coming
I should have f*cking known
How I could I let you play me
I don't even know

I should have known
My family they never did pretend
My mama felt she never liked you
neither did my friends
And then you blamed it all on me
I should have known that's what liars try to do
It wasn't me it was you
You're the fool and I should have known

I should have f*cking known
How I could I let you play me
I don't even know
I should have seen it coming
I should have f*cking known
How I could I let you play me
I don't even know

If your heart is simple just like mine is
Then you would know just how it feels
When someone takes adavantage of your kindness
You think you're never gonna heal
If your soul is deep just like mine is
then you would know not to give up
Keep my faith even through the darkness
yeah I still believe in love"
Pop,"The sun is shining so brightly
The sea is waiting so sweet
And now I'm feeling so lucky
Cuz I got you tonight here with me
You know I'm crazy about you
Like never been in my life
My dancing lady you so good
Let me stay by your side for a while

I'll got you, I'll got you see
It's not I see
I'll got you, I'll got you see
Call I'll got you under my skin
I'll got you, I'll got you see
It's not I see
I'll got you, I'll got you see
Call I'll got you under my skin

I am so proud of been your respect
My heart is right in your hand
And you can see how I hope
That it is true and it will never end
Your soul divine and delicious
The one who's driving me while
I don't know how I should treat you
Like a queen or a wonderful

I'll got you, I'll got you see
It's not I see
I'll got you, I'll got you see
Call I'll got you under my skin
I'll got you, I'll got you see
It's not I see
I'll got you, I'll got you see
Call I'll got you under my skin

You know I'm crazy about you

Call I'll got you under my skin
I'll got you, I'll got you see
It's not I see
I'll got you, I'll got you see
Call I'll got you under my skin"
Pop,"I've got too much pressure building
Sometimes life's so unfulfilling
How much can we bend before we break
Empty airless conversation
Overwrought with my frustrations
Pull the panic cord, need to escape

If I fall, will I feel, some more, something real (Something real)
Breaking down, breaking out, from the thoughts, from the doubt (Ooh)

Don't hold your breath, gotta let it go
Dive deeper in, into the unknown
If you don't try then you'll never know
So take a breath, just take a breath
And let it all go, go, let it all go
Let it go, let it go

The world is lacking in emotion
So caught up in the commotion
Always reaching out for something more
Hunted by the fear of fading
Losing sight of what we're craving
Makes me wonder what we're waiting for

If I fall, will I feel, some more, something real (Something real)
Breaking down, breaking out, from the thoughts, from the doubt (Ooh)

Don't hold your breath, gotta let it go
Dive deeper in, into the unknown
If you don't try then you'll never know
So take a breath, just take a breath
And let it all go, go, let it all go
Let it go, let it go

Leave your troubles in yesterday
Don't worry you will be Ok
Whenever you feel afraid
Just let it go (Let it go)

Don't hold your breath, gotta let it go
Dive deeper in, into the unknown
If you don't try then you'll never know
So take a breath, just take a breath
And let it all go, go, let it all go
Let it go, let it go (Oh)"
Pop,"Put your head against my life
What do you hear
A million words just trying to make
The love song of the year

Close your eyes, but don't forget
What you have heard
A man who´s trying to say a few words
Words that makes me scared

Chorus:
A million lovesongs later
And here I am trying to tell you
That I care
A million lovesongs later
And here I am

Look in to the future now
this is what I see
A million chances past me by
A million chances to hold you

Take me back - take me back
To were I use to be
And hide away from all my throughts
Through the light i see

Chorus

I missed a million, a million chances to love you
I missed a million, a million chances to show you that I care
I missed a million, a million chances too tough
So baby will you always be there

Chorus
"
Pop,"Driving along in the storm
But we're together
Mountains could fall to the ground
We don't hear a sound
I hear you voice
Simply deving
I have no choise
I'll tell you why

Love you without trying
It's always been that way
Love you without trying
And in your arms I'll stay

Even when we're apart
Time never lonely
You were a space in my heart
No one could fill
Millions of stars
A light in the sky
Filling this burn
I'll tell ya why

Love you without trying
It's always been that way
When my heart was dying
U took my pain away

Even when the sun is goin'
U're the light to guide me home
And be the best in everything I do
U are every part of me
U make me who I want to be
A higher love is what I feel for you

Love you without trying
It's always been that way
When my heart was dying
U took my pain away"
Pop,"Baby I knew at once
That you were meant for me
Deep in my soul I know
That I'm your destiny
Though you're unsure
Why fight the tide
Don't think so much
Let your heart decide

Baby I see your future
And it's tied to mine
I look in your eyes
And see you searching for a sign
But you'll never fall
'Til you let go
Don't be so scared
Of what you don't know

True to your heart
You must be true to your heart
That's when the heavens will part
And baby shower you with my love
Open your eyes
Your heart can tell you no lies
And when you're true to your heart
I know it's gonna lead you straight to me
(Got to be true to your heart)

Someone you know is on your side
Can set you free
I can do that for you
If you believe in me
Why second-guess
What feels so right
Just trust your heart
And you'll see the light

True to your heart
You must be true to your heart
That's when the heavens will part
And baby shower you with my love
Open your eyes
Your heart can tell you no lies
And when you're true to your heart
I know it's gonna lead you straight to me
(Got to be true to your heart)

(Ya know it's true)
Your heart knows what's good for you
(Good for you)
Let your heart show you the way
(Ya know it's true)
It'll see you through
(Got to be true to your heart)

Boy my heart is driving me to where you are
You can take both hands off the wheel and
Still get far
Be swept away enjoy the ride
You won't get lost
With your heart to guide you

True to your heart
You must be true to your heart
That's when the heavens will part
And baby shower you with my love
Open your eyes
Your heart can tell you no lies
And when you're true to your heart
I know it's gonna lead you straight to me
(Got to be true to your heart)

When things are getting crazy
And you don't know where to start
Keep on believing baby
Just be true to your heart
When all the world around you
It seems to fall apart
Keep on believing baby
Just be true to your heart"
Pop,"Sometimes I see your face looking at me
All your love and grace smiling at me
All the things we had and never understood
At times it cuts me up thinking of you
All the hope has gone wasted on you
All the talks we had never did no good

Chorus:
Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me 'cos you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Pour another glass
While I watch the bottle disappear
While I watch the morning light appear
Thinking about you

Chorus x2

I met this girl last night and she said
""Why won't you marry me?""
He met this girl last night and she said
""Why won't you marry me?""

But I'm too young for that
Too dumb for that
Too broke for that
Too tired for that
Too proud for that
And I'm too gone for that
Would you like to come back to my flat?

Chorus

Oh maybe(oh maybe) I don't want to save me
I just want you to help me 'cos you're keeping me up all night
(Why don't you do that for me?)
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Come on just say you""ll stay"
Pop,"Hold on, where you goin', pretty lady?
I'll take you for a ride, I can see it in your eyes
Wanna hop up in my passenger seat, baby
We'll take the city by surprise, it's just me and you tonight

Now, yeah we ride a little, freak
Ain't slowin' down, won't stop for nothin'
'Less we on E
Now, yeah, love the way you're lookin' at me
The wind all up in your hair, and we rollin', just me and you

Baby we can go wherever you want, want, want
Are you with me? Why don't you take the seat in the front?
And we rollin', we rollin', your hands are all on me
Doin' 95 in a '65, tryin' to chase eternity
And I want you with me
We rollin', we rollin'

Girl I got some [?] , ain't you noticed?
But Luther ain't the only thing playin' through my bones
Got a feeling, I can't shake it
Girl I'm hopeless
I gotta have you right here with me

Now, yeah we ride a little, freak
Ain't slowin' down, won't stop for nothin'
'Less we on E
Now, yeah, love the way you're lookin' at me
The wind all up in your hair, and we rollin', just me and you

Baby we can go wherever you want
Are you with me? Why don't you take the seat in the front?
And we rollin', we rollin', your hands are all on me
Doin' 95 in a '65, tryin' to chase eternity
And I want you with me
We rollin', we rollin'

(Becky G)
I love it, I love it, I love it
I love it, I love it, I love it
Bring it back, bring it back
Boy you make my heart stop, heart attack
Windows down and we goin' fast
Don't care where we goin' next
As long as it's you, me with the radio loud
Sun shinin' bright while we're cruisin' your town
East side of the west side
By you is the best side
I could do this every day
No, no don't step on the brakes
Munchin' on that Chick-fil-a
Off of fries and a large lemonade
I love when we up in the streets
Down by my hood or the beach
Got one hand on my thigh, other hand on the window
It don't get no better than me

Baby we can go wherever you want
Are you with me? Why don't you take the seat in the front?
And we rollin', we rollin', your hands are all on me
Doin' 95 in a '65, tryin' to chase eternity
And I want you with me
We rollin', we rollin'"
Pop,"[Chorus x3]
Hey now, hey now
What's the matter with you?
Girls just wanna have fun now
Come on...

I come home in the morning light
My mother says when you gonna live your life right
Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones
And girls they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have fun

[Chorus]
Hey now, hey now
What's the matter with you?
Girls just wanna have fun now
Come on...

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells what you gonna do with your life
Oh daddy dear you know you're still number one
But girls they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have
That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
You know girls
They want to have fun

[Chorus x2]
Hey now, hey now
What's the matter with you?
Girls just wanna have fun now
Come on...

Single mint double mint triple mint gum
We're just 3 girls that wanna have some fun
If you party with us
You're gonna be a while
You gotta roll like us triple image style
There ain't nothin gonna stop us or get in our way
We're gonna be on the top by the end of the day
Cuz we got the look and we got the groove
Triple image gonna make you move
Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I want to be the one to walk in the sun

Hey now, hey now
What's the matter with you?
Girls just wanna have fun now
Come on...

When the working day is done girls
They want to have fun

[Chorus x2]
Hey now, hey now
What's the matter with you?
Girls just wanna have fun now
Come on...

And the boys they wanna have fun
And the girls they wanna have fun
And the boys they wanna have fun
And the girls they wanna have fun
And the boys they wanna have fun
And the girls they wanna have fun
And the boys they wanna have fun
And the girls they wanna have...

Hey now, hey now
What's the matter with you?
Girls just wanna have fun now

Pop,"He's right in the crossword
So he doesn't notice me
I'm staring across the room
And so is she
Looking at you I wonder,
If there's somewhere else you'd rather be

He pays her no attention as he takes another call
Just want to rescue her from it all
I wanna rock right over
Say you don't need him anymore

Let's just pretend
We're somebody else
And I was someone
That you want for yourself
No secrets that hide
And we leave the past behind
Yeah

Why don't we just go
Walk right out the door
When we're leaving
We won't look back any more
Why don't we just go, go, go
Go, go, go

If I was to gamble would I win or would I lose
Tell you where my thoughts are racing to
Is it too much to handle
Or would I be the one you'd choose

Let's just pretend
We're somebody else
And I was someone
That you want for yourself
No secrets that hide
And we leave the past behind
Yeah
Why don't we just go
Walk right out the door
When we're leaving
We won't look back any more

All these sliding doors
That we could explore
All the lifetimes
When you were mine
That we lived before
We've come so close
But you're so far
Still I can't feel everything that you are
You're in my head
You're in my heart
No happy end if we don't even start

Why don't we just go
Walk right out the door
When we're leaving
We won't look back any more

All these sliding doors
That we could explore
All the lifetimes
When you were mine
That we lived before
We've come so close
But you're so far
Still I can't feel everything that you are
You're in my head (in my head)
You're in my heart (in my heart)
No happy end if we don't even start

We've come so close (so close)
But you're so far (so far)
Still I can't feel everything that you are
You're in my head (in my head)
You're in my heart (in my heart)
No happy end if we don't even start"
Pop,"Blaze it up and we'll be cruisin' with the top down
Rev up the engine we'll be cruisin' watch it go down
Get in my truck
And I'll be ridin' with my top down
With my top down
My top down

From a small town cruisin' thru the big city
Where the fellas are cute and the girls are pretty
It's our world so you know it's going down
I ain't got a lotta money but I got a lotta style
What what

Blaze it up and we'll be cruisin' with the top down
Rev up the engine we'll be cruisin' watch it go down
Get in my truck
And I'll be ridin' with my top down
With my top down
My top down

Electric city
Baby you're mine tonight
Electric city
Don't you shine bright
Electric city
Baby you light the way
Electric city
I think that I might stay

Passed out real and I woke up realer
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Me and my clique goin' hard and you feel us
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Come on let me take you for a ride
I ain't got a lot of money but I got a lotta style
What what


Blaze it up and we'll be cruisin' with the top down
Rev up the engine we'll be cruisin' watch it go down
Get in my truck
And I'll be ridin' with my top down
With my top down
My top down"
Pop,"Destiny

Got a twisted hungry feeling
It's a hunger for you
There's a midnight train that keeps on runnin'
keeps on runnin' trough
These empty hours I should be sleeping
Swimming in my dreams
But tonight my mind is dancing
I'm tearing at the seams

What we had, what we lost
We gave to yesterday
a kiss and a smile
For a little while
But heaven's blew away

I believe in Destiny
One more time for you and me
So let it out and let me in
We can fly so let's begin

I believe in Destiny
Tonight is ours eternally
So give it up and make it true
Set me free cause I want you

Gotta keep this moment movin'
It's a 'Deja Vû'
Your memory keeps rolling in
But life keeps spinnin' through

And though we've both been far away
We've never been apart
Time and space can't erase
The love that's in my heart

I believe in Destiny
One more time for you and me
So let it out and let me in
We can fly so let's begin

I believe in Destiny
Tonight is ours eternally
So give it up and make it true
Set me free cause I want you

I believe, I believe , I believe

I believe in Destiny
One more time for you and me
So let it out and let me in
We can fly so let's begin

I believe in Destiny
Tonight is ours eternally
So give it up and make it true
Set me free cause I want you

REPEATS TO FADE
"
Pop,"I can't imagine what a world would be
I can't imagine what a world would be
I can't imagine what a world would be

Without you, all the birds would stop their songs
Without you, all things right would feel so wrong

I can't imagine what a world would be
No, I can't imagine what a world would be
No, I can't imagine what a world would be

Without you, I'd always be alone
Without you, I don't know where to go

I can't imagine what a world would be
No, I can't imagine what a world could be
I can't imagine what a world would be
I can't imagine
I can't imagine, no
I can't imagine, no, what a world would be
Without you

I'd always be alone
I'd always be alone
Cool, that's good for now"
Pop,"Mmm oooo

I know great distance still remains between us
But there's good reason to hold on
It's the happiest time of the year
Filled with laughter and good cheer
As you watch the snow
Sweet love, you'll hear me say

Chorus:
You've got my heart on Christmas
Inside my soul, your love remains
Love's in our hearts on Christmas day

The days and weeks and months go by so slowly
We are both wishing it would fly oh
As the night begins to fall
Twilight drowns the bedroom cheer
Such a rush with joy (rush with joy)
And love, it comforts me
And I do believe

Chorus 2:
Love's in our hearts on Christmas
Though far apart
As one we pray
Love's in our hearts on Christmas day

A snowflake melts
In your eye it turns to a tear
But your cheek, it stays dry
With your warm smile so near
I have no fear
We're gonna make it
Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo

Chorus 2

"
Pop,"I used to be broken
Stuck in a cage
I used to be low down
I couldn't be saved
Now I feel like a lion
That cannot be tamed
Cause you brought me back to life, to life again

I was fearless but so easily
I let life fade away the colour of my dreams
Now you're with me, I know I can be
Higher, higher than higher

(You're lifting me up)
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be on the ground
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be out of my mind
Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You're lifting me up)
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be lost in the fire
If you weren't, you weren't here
Couldn't open up my eyes
Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You're lifting me up)

The sky is a long way
When covered in rain
You gave me my vision
You gave me my faith
And now I'm a fighter
I found the flame
You set me alight, alight again

I was fearless but so easily
I let life fade away the colour of my dreams
Now you're with me, I know I can be
Higher, higher than higher

(You're lifting me up)
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be on the ground
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be out of my mind
Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You're lifting me up)
If you weren't, you weren't here
I'd be lost in the fire
If you weren't, you weren't here
Couldn't open up my eyes
Cos you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You're lifting me up)

Just one way for us now
There's no coming down
You've brought me back to life
So I'm gonna go up
Higher, higher than higher
Higher than higher, higher than higher

(You're lifting me up)
Cause you are, you are here
I got my feet off the ground
Cause you are, you are here
Still losing my mind
Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher

Cause you are, you are here
Now I've found the fire
Cause you are, you are here
I can open up my eyes
Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher
Higher than higher
Higher than higher
Higher, higher than higher
Higher, higher than higher
Higher, higher than higher
Higher, higher than higher
You're lifting me up
Higher, higher than higher
Higher, higher than higher"
Pop,"Walls are shaking now
That your windows break
This place is out of control
This place is out of control

Everybody in a trance
All we wanna do is dance
This place is out of control
Yeah we are out of control

When the sadness comes
It got us sitting all alone
Cause we don't wanna go home
Yeah we don't wanna go home

Cause now the party is over
We just wanna get louder
We never ever wanna stop
We can move this to the parking lot

Let's take this somewhere else
Cause now the party is over
We don't wanna get older
We never ever wanna stop

Now it's time for us to light it up
Take it somewhere else
Cause now the party is ov-er er

The sun comes up now
All we do is stand and talk
Cause we are out of control

The time is ours
Got the people in my car

It got us sitting all alone
Cause we don't wanna go home

Pop,"Damn, you look so good with your clothes on
And I'm not trying to come off too strong
But you know that I can't help it
Cause girl you're beautiful
I can't deny I want your body
But I'm a gentleman
So I'll be the one who takes it slowly
Cause girl you're so beautiful

I wanna love you with the lights on
Keep you up all night long
Darling I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost on the way you move

I wanna love you with the lights on
Hold you till night's gone
Darling I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost on the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on

I like the vibe in this hotel room
I'd really like to get to know you
Start discovering your secrets
Underneath these very sheets

Your skin's so perfect up against me
Your lips are talking when we don't speak
And I never wanna leave this
Cause there's so much left to see

I wanna love you with the lights on
Keep you up all night long
Darling I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move

I wanna love you with the lights on
Hold you till the night's gone
Darling I wanna see every inch of you

Pop,"If you got an answer
Girl, I could really use it
Ship on my shoulder
You know I could stay, to lose it

Don't let us waste no time, no!
A good thing is hard to find, oh!
And you know exactly
What's on my mind

Ooh la la! It's such a turn-me-on lady
Ooh la la! It's such a beautiful you
Ma ma ma ma! It's such a funky young lady
Ooh la la! It's such a beautiful you

Nobody warned me
That someone so young, so sweetly
Can do how you do me
More than I could be done so deeply

You got what you got and you know it
I can tell by the way you show it
This is your chance
Come on! Let's not blow it

Ooh la la! It's such a turn-me-on lady
Ooh la la! It's such a beautiful you
Ma ma ma ma! It's such a funky young lady
Ooh la la! It's such a beautiful you

You got what you got and you know it
I can tell by the way you show it, Ooh!
This is our chance
Honey! Let's not blow it

Ooh la la! It's such a turn-me-on lady
Ooh la la! It's such a beautiful you
Ooh la la! It's such a, such a, such a beautiful you
Yeah! It's such a, such a beautiful you
That's a funky young lady"
Pop,"We've been here many times before
Leaving rooms and slamming doors
We're climbing up the bedroom walls
Sometimes we make it so frustrating
I touch your mouth, I touch your lips
The answers at our fingertips
Not giving up or giving in
Why are we so complicated?

Oh tell me what to say, tell me
To make It all ok

I don't wanna see you hurting
Just hold on
Just hold on to me
I don't wanna see you crying
So hold on
So hold on to me

I'm tryin' to think of what to do
To really make it up to you
So many truths, too many lies
Making love can be so crazy
I find myself back here again
Asking you to let me in
You know it's time, we need to change
How can we live with all these maybes?

There are no words that say, no words
To make it go away

I don't wanna see you hurting
Just hold on
Just hold on to me
I don't wanna see you crying
So hold on
So hold on to me

'Cause baby it's alright
I'm staying here tonight
So hold on

Just tell me what to say
To let you know I'll always stay

I don't wanna see you hurting
Just hold on
Just hold on to me
I don't wanna see you crying
So hold on
So hold on to me

Pop,"I couldn't wait another minute when I had you here again
I couldn't wait no longer
'Cause baby it's been more than minutes since we were more than friends
All of this time I thought,
I thought that nothing had changed But it's all the same

Here we go
Once again you and I are more than friends
Here we go
Makin' love again
Here we go
Even though we both know this is not right
Here we go
Makin' love another night

Makin' lopve to you is easy It's something that I missed so long
Baby the way that you please me it feels so right It can't be wring
All of this time I thougt,
I thought that nothing had changed But it's all the same
"
Pop,"It's not that I'm afraid I'm not enough for her
It's not that I can't find the words to say
But when she's with him, she seems happier
And I don't want to take that away

How many times can I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
I just have to let you know

I'm not tryna start a fire with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me If I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?
Die or let it grow?

It's not that I don't care about the love you have
It's not that I don't want to see you smile
But there's no way that he can feel the same
Cause when I think of you my mind goes wild

How many times can I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
I just have to let you know

I'm not tryna start a fire with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me If I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?

You can tell me stop if you already know
Though I'm not sure my heart can take it
But the look on your face says don't let me go

I'm not tryna start a fire with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me If I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?

I'm not tryna start a fire with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same

Pop,"Fall down at your feet gary barlow, mark owen, howard donald

I've given all that I can give
Is only what I wanted
Holding you is easier to breathe
The more I lose the less it hurts
The hurt is saning me
I'm on my knees, so please

I, I wanna fall down at your feet
Why? Why do you bring me to my knees?
I, I wanna fall down at your feet
Down on my knees, on my knees

Take it all, I take the fall
Don't have to give it back
I give you the world, so tell me when to stop
Anything you want, anytime you want, tell me what you need
I'd give you the world, so tell me when to stop

I, I wanna fall down at your feet
Why? Why do you bring me to my knees?
I, I wanna fall down at your feet
Down on my knees, on my knees

Anything you want, anytime you want, tell me what you need

I, I wanna fall down at your feet
Down on my knees, on my knees
Down on my knees, on my knees
Down on my knees, on my knees"
Pop,"I’m always at the place where your friends meet
It’s the long way home but I walk your street
And when I trip and fall right at your feet
It’s not accidental

I make it feel like luck is in the air
Every time you turn I’m standing there
You look into the stars, our names are clear
It’s not accidental

And when you get a wrong number
Don’t hang up too soon
Stop and wonder

You are the one that’s meant for me
I’m twisting fate to make believe
It’s all accidental
This was always meant to be
When you’re in my arms then you will see
It wasn’t accidental

I know you like the kind of clothes I wear
Think I threw them on without a care
The style’s from a book you read a magazine you left
It’s not coincidental

And even when you hear your favorite song
You don’t know but I put it on
You bought the record yesterday so I knew what to play
It’s not coincidental

This all feels right time, right place
Cos every time I see you face to face our future calls
Not saying U bend the truth just doing my best to get to you
Made you my destiny"
Pop,"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)""
by Joan Osborne

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you
were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs and
there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brighten up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

You were better for me than I was for myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you"
Pop,"Once doesn?t mean anything to me
Come; show me the meaning of complete
Where did our love go wrong?
Once we were so strong
How can I go on?

(Chorus:)
When you told me you loved me
Did you know it would take me the rest of my life?
To get over the feeling of knowing? in a dream
Didn?t turn out right
When you let me believe
That you were incomplete without me by your side
How could I know?
That you would go, that you would run
Baby I thought you were the one

Why can't I just leave it all behind?
I felt passion so bright that I was blind
Then something made me weak
Talking in my sleep
Baby I'm in so deep and you know I believe

(Chorus)

Your lips, your face, something that time just can't erase
My heart could break all over again

(Chorus)"
Pop,"You got the best part of me with you
There's no hole in me, no one else to fill
I know that all the wishing in the world
Couldn't bring you here
Come on, let's be real

And all these time
I try to fake a smile
But I can't fake it
And all the wild light
Tryna take it slow
But I can't take it

Miles away
And I just wanna be with you
Shy to be where you are
Miles away
And there's nothing I could do
You're like a distant star
Miles away

It's so strange to hear about your new life
When we used to be together all the time
When you went away
You left your footprints
On the front door
And see your drops in the ice

And all these time
I try to fake a smile
But I can't fake it
And all the wild light
Tryna take it slow
But I can't take it

I can't take it

Miles away
And I just wanna be with you
Shy to be where you are
Miles away
And there's nothing I could do
You're like a distant star
Miles away

Miles away
You don't even know
What you're doing to me
What you're doing to me

Miles away

Miles away
And I just wanna be with you
Shy to be where you are
Miles away
And there's nothing I could do
You're like a distant star
Miles away
And I just wanna be with you
Shy to be where you are
Miles away
And there's nothing I could do
You're like a distant star
Miles away"
Pop,"Maya this song's for you
I have your name print tattooed upon my skin
There's so much to say to you
And where do I begin?

Cos all these prayers must be going somewhere
Somewhere I can never trace
But it seems so far look in the stars
And the empty space

Chorus:
There are worlds within worlds, that keep rotating
And so many thoughts that flow through my mind
If this universe is really shrinking
We'll be together in time

I had a vision of this place
It looked like heaven but the colours seemed to change
And no matter what I do yeah
It's slowly fading away

So all of these prayers have to be going somewhere
Somewhere I can never trace
And one could get lost in all of these stars
And drift in space

Chorus:
There are worlds within worlds, that keep rotating
And so many thoughts that flow through my mind
If this universe is really shrinking
We'll be together in time

Chorus:
There are worlds within worlds, that keep rotating
And so many thoughts that flow through my mind
If this universe is really shrinking
We'll be together in time

Chorus:
There are worlds within worlds, that keep rotating
And so many thoughts that flow through my mind
If this universe is really shrinking
We'll be together in time

Pop,"When Joseph was an old man, an old man was he
He married Virgin Mary, the Queen of Galilee
He married Virgin Mary, the Queen of Galilee

Mary and Joseph walked through an orchard green
There were berries and cherries, as thick as might be seen
There were berries and cherries, as thick as might be seen

When Mary said to Joseph, so meek and so mild
Joseph, gather me some cherries, for I am with child
Joseph, gather me some cherries, for I am with child

Then Joseph flew in anger, in anger flew he
Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee!
Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee!

Then up spoke baby Jesus, from in Mary's womb
Bend down the tallest tree, that my mother might have some
Bend down the tallest tree, that my mother might have some

Then bend down the tallest branch, it touched Mary's hand
Cried she, oh look thou Joseph, I have cherries by command
Oh look thou Joseph, I have cherries by command"
Pop,"I had this perfect dream
This dream was me and you
I want all the world to see
A miracle sensation
My guide and inspiration
Now my dream is slowly coming true

The wind is a gentle breeze
She blows for me so true
The bells are ringing out
They are calling us together
Guiding us forever
Wish this dream would never go away

Barcelona - (Barcelona) It was the first time that we met
Barcelona - (Barcelona) I can not forget
The moment that she walked into the room she took my breath away
(Barcelona - The music vibrates me)
Barcelona - (Barcelona) La musica vibros
Barcelona - (Barcelona) Y ella nos unio
If God is willing we will meet again someday

Let the songs begin (songs begin, songs begin)
Let the music play (music play, music play)
Make the voices sing (the voices sing)
Start the celebration (start the celebration)
Without a hesitation
And cry (and cry)
Come alive (and cry, and cry)
And shake the foundations from the skies
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, shaking all our lives)
(The music vibrate me, Barcelona)

Barcelona - It's such a beautiful horizon
Barcelona - (Barcelona) Like a jewel in the sun
Por ti sere gaviota de tu bella mar
(Let the music vibrate me, Barcelona)
Barcelona - Suenan las campamas
Barcelona - (Barcelona) Abre tus puertas al mundo
If God is willing
If God is willing
Friends until the end
(Friends until the end)
Barcelona
(Friends until the end, friends until the end)
Barcelona
(Friends until the end, friends until the end)

Pop,"I've lost my way
And day by day
Playing tough is hard enough
When the sun is out
Tougher, in rain

Oh, your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reason to give all my love
Making it okay to let go

When I was little I was so sure of myself
Yeah, I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my faith grows old as well
Yeah, when I was little I was so sure of myself
Sure of myself (self)
Sure of myself (self)
Sure of myself (self)
Sure of myself (self)

And if I've lost my way (how am I still here)
Still standing straight (how am I still here)
I'm looking up to find I'm tough
When the sun goes down
And I feel the change

Oh, your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reason to give all my love
Making it okay to let go

When I was little I was so sure of myself
Yeah, I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my faith grows old as well
Yeah, when I was little I was so sure of myself
Sure of myself (self)
Sure of myself (self)
Sure of myself (self)

Oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reasons to give all my love
Making it okay to let go
And oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reasons to give all my love
Making it okay to let go

When I was little I was so sure of myself (yeah)
Yeah, I knew so little but I felt with every cell

Pop,"I\'d Wait For Life\""

There\'s a place we used to be
There\'s a face that I used to see
There\'s a picture with you by my side
There\'s a moment that I want to find.

I don\'t know where to start
Or how to begin
But I kow I love you still.

If you ever turn away
If you ever change your mind
If the road ahead becomes too hard to climb
If there\'s something in your heart that tells you to stop
Oh to hold you close tonight
I\'d wait for life.

There\'s a voice shouting inside my head
There\'s a space on your side of the bed
There\'s a hope everytime there\'s a sound
There\'s a silence that\'s playing too loud

I don\'t know how you are
Or how you may be
But I know I love you still.

If I close my eyes
I\'ll dream a little deeper baby
\'Cause you are always on my mind
Yeah you are always on my mind
For life."
Pop,"You're nothing but a guy I know
Just a friend of a friend for show
Your innocence distracted me
Couple drinks got me flirty

But if you had a girlfriend, I think that I would know
We may have had that one night, let's keep it on the low
Don't memorize my number or keep me in your phone
Your kiss I can't remember, but everybody knows

So hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Huh-huh, baby just hush

Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Huh-huh, baby just hush

They talkin' like we broke the law
It's just your lips, well they caught my fall
And I didn't know you keep her close
I guess this is how it goes

But if she was your girlfriend, I think that I would know
Yeah we had that one night, shoulda kept it on the low
Don't memorize my number or keep me in your phone
Your kiss I can't remember, but everybody knows

Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Huh-huh, baby just hush

Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Huh-huh, baby just hush

Yo, real talk, I don't want none of it
Just stop, cause I ain't got time for this
One simple mistake in one night
Two bottles of wine just to feel right

But I guess I'm messin' with the wrong guy
And now his ex is textin' him like: Why
Why you gotta be kissin' on my good friends?
I went and told him, yo this has gotta end

If she was your girlfriend, I think that I would know
Yeah we had that one night, shoulda kept it on the low
Don't memorize my number or keep me in your phone
Your kiss I can't remember, but everybody knows

Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Huh-huh, baby just hush

Give it all away

Why don't you teach your heart to talk
And give you love love
Give you love love
Give me give me what I need

We'll take you right back down to the earth from the mother land

Pop,"I never wanted to feel like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never ever, again will i trust you
I never wanted to be like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never ever again will i trust you

I'm tired of sittin' home waiting fot the phone to ring
While you're out doing any and everything
And everybody sees how you're playing me
Calling me your girl

But I'm not gonna sit sround and take this foolishness
You're acting like I can't see a man and take my pick
You better play it cool
Or this game you'll lose
I'm telling you the truth

So don't you try to tell me
You've been true to me
When I can plainly see
That in your heart you're still a cheat
And I know that you're lovesick
It's not happening
So don't you come to me
Thinking I'll believe 'cause
It won't work for me

I never wanted to feel like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never ever again will i trust you
I never wanted to be like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never ever again will i trust you

What makes you think I
Would sit here and be fool
If you think that it's true, you don't have a clue
I just could not believe
That you're playing me
Boy, what's wrong with you

Since you're the man
Thinking that you could play the game
I think I have to show you
That you don't mean a thing
I'm letting you go
So if you didn't know
I am in control

So don't you try to tell me
You've been true to me
When I can plainly see
That in your heart you're still a cheat
And I know that you're lovesick
It's not happening
So don't you come to me
Thinking I'll believe 'cause
It won't work for me

I never wanted to feel like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never ever again will i trust you
I never wanted to be like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never ever again will i trust you

I never wanted to feel like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never ever again will i trust you
I never wanted to be like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never ever again will i trust you

Baby did you think that
You could play me
like I would never know
(Could you be so)
Shady
(Now you're gonna see)
You should never spend your
Time with me
'Cause there's no you and me
We can never be

I never wanted to feel like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never ever again will i trust you
I never wanted to be like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never ever again will i trust you (x2)

Pop,"I dreamed about Ray Charles last night
And he could see just fine

Dreamed about Ray Charles last night
And he could see just fine, you know
I asked him for a lullaby
He said, ""Honey, I don't sing no more""
No more, no more, no more
Ray don't sing no more

He said, ""Since I got my eyesight back,
my voice has just deserted me.
No 'Georgia On My Mind' no more...
I stay in bed with MTV.""

Then Ray took his glasses off
And I could look inside his head
Flashing like a thunderstorm
I saw a shining spider web

Spider web (repeat 3x)
In Ray Charles' head

I dreamed about Ray Charles last night
He took me flying in the air
Showed my own spider webs
Said, ""Honey, you had best take care.
The world is made of spider webs
The threads are stuck to me and you
Be careful what you're wishing for
'Cause when you gain you just might lose""
You just might lose your...

Spider web (repeat 3x)
What Ray Charles said

When you're feelin' lonely
When you're hidin' in your bed
Don't forget your string of pearls
Don't forget your spider web

When I go to sleep tonight
Don't let me dream of brother Ray
No, no, no, don't...
Don't get me wrong, I'm glad he sees
Just like him best the other way

Spider web (repeat 3x)
What Ray Charles said...
In Ray Charles head

All I got's my spider web
Keepin' me alive
C'mon Ray

Pop,"Good job 1st

I fell in love with a sunset, I fell in love with a cloud
I don't remember how I got here, I just know I'm lookin' down
It's fun up here, feelin' real good
Man, it's fun up here, I'm feelin' real good
I feel in love with my damn self
My freckles and my back (My freckles and my back)
I fell in love with the whole world, I know it loves me back
That's why it put me high
It's fun up here, feelin' real good
It's fun up here, I'm feelin' real good
I'm just slidin' down a rainbow, got a lot leg room
I'm lookin' for my pot of gold (I'm lookin' for my pot of gold)
I know I'll get it soon
Uh, I got love in my blood, man, I'm feelin' real yummy
John Hamilton and Attaman, I'm keepin' good company
I call my pair of eyes ""Pretty, "" and a rainy day is ugly
Man, I ain't got nothin', so you can't take nothin' from me
'Cause it's fun up here, and I'm real good
You know it's fun up here, I'm feelin' real good

Yeah, uh
I woke up today in a mansion
I'm seven out of ten handsome
But my talent make me a ten [?]
Kick it to the curb, Ted Dancin'
Chillin' in a droptop, pedal to the high top, my studio is a hotbox
No baby, don't stop, no baby, don't drop
Can't see these haters like a Bird Box
Livin' on food stamps, dyin' on wealthfare
Dyin', and I had no healthcare
Wake up blessed everyday, life's slippin' away
And I'm actin' like I don't care
I got a job, I got a bed, I got a beautiful home, I ain't there
I got a mind on my own, I'm rich, but the money
Money can't fill your heart, money can't fill your heart (No, no, no, no)
Money can't fill your heart, money can't fill your heart (No, no, no, no)
Money can't fill your heart, money can't fill your heart (No, no, no, no)
Money can't fill your heart, only love can fill your heart, only fill your heart

It's fun up here, feelin' real good
Man, it's fun up here, I'm feelin' real good"
Pop,"Last night I died
You gave me one look, I cried
I don't know what you did, but
Now I'm shook up, now I'm love-drunk
Need a doctor, couldn't make it out last night
'Cause I died

Oh my God, I hope I didn't blow my shot
But I was so unprepared, I just stared at you
You turned around and said my name
I didn't think you'd know my name
The blood is rushing to my face
There's no grace with you
MM, you got me mumbling like, na-la-la-la-la
You got me stuttering like, I-I-I-I
I'm fine, how 'bout you? Wait, I already asked that, oops

Last night I died
You gave me one look, I cried
I don't know what you did, but
Now I'm shook up, now I'm love-drunk
Need a doctor, couldn't make it out last night
'Cause I died

Last night I died
I-In my brain, I'm playing out the things we'd say
So tell me what I wanna hear, let's get out of here
Oh-oh, take my hand
You told me that you'll never dance
But you're looking for any excuse to get real close to me
MM, you got me mumbling like, na-la-la-la-la
You got me stuttering like, I-I-I-I
I'm fine, how 'bout you? Wait, I already asked that, oops

Last night I died
You gave me one look, I cried
I don't know what you did, but
Now I'm shook up, now I'm love-drunk
Need a doctor, couldn't make it out last night
'Cause I died
Last night I died"
Pop,"It's all over like steps in the first snow
Something's been building up and it's gonna blow
My momma called me last night, she said when nothing else fits
Pick up the pieces and move on
I see the flashing red lights, just can't make sense of the bits
it's like my mind is gone

[Chrorus]
I got. .. got to get. ..
Get my head back on
I got. .. got to get. ..
Myself together
When this hurt is gone
I got. .. got to get. ..
Myself together

I got. .. got to get. ..
I can't tell what's right or wrong
I wish that something could be done
I'm not that clever
When this hurt is gone
I got. .. got to get. ..
Myself together

Can't stand to see you upset
But you already know
The more close it gets
The less I wanna go

I saw my brother last night
He said I know you too well
You can't pretend that nothing's wrong
I see the fuse that ignites, like I'm outside of myself
it's like my mind is gone

[Chrorus]
I got. .. got to get. ..
Get my head back on

When this hurt is gone
I got. .. got to get. ..
Myself together

My daddy pulled me aside
Like when I was a child
He said I'll trust you decide
On what you know is right
And for whatever it's worth,
I am on your side
there's no denying the mess
That I got us in
And I've been trying my best
Not to make a scene
Just can't make sense of it all
it's like my mind is gone

[Chrorus]
I got. .. got to get. ..
Get my head back on

Didn't have bread, more like a burrito
Then I was mad, he was just bad
I don't really, really wanna think about that
Then I saw you, you were so cool
Had me like ooh, I was like dude
Not to be rude, he got it like that
Celebrate, you hear me man?

Pop,"I'll be your king
I'll be your queen
And all that happens in between
I'll be your fix
Your lucky dice
And here in Wonderland in paradise
Your serenator
Your hall of fame
Your force of nature
And back again
Your last confession
Your holy grail
Your first impression
From London to the Usa

Music makes me feel good
Music makes me feel good
Get on my feet, get on my knees for it
Music makes me feel good
Music makes me feel good
Everybody's feeling wonderland

I'll take my place
My majesty
So put on your crown and dance with me
My fate awaits, a celebration
A part of your society
Don't leave me waiting
Don't leave me here
The life and times of
This time of year
My reelection
My final stand
My words of wisdom
From heaven to the promised land

Music makes me feel good
Music makes me feel good
Get on my feet, get on my knees for it
Music makes me feel good
Music makes me feel good

And the music fills my body
And the music gives me joy
And the music keeps me company
When I need somewhere to cry
Yeah, the feeling is sensational
And you gotta understand
How the music makes me feel wonderland

All your dreams are made
All your dreams are made
In Wonderland

Pop,"Hey, hey

I know it sounds crazy, but time doesn't faze me
Every since it's lost, it's hold on me
Hang out to midnight, miss the curfew's that's alright
And back to bed, right on time will see

Whenever you need me, I'm right there with you
Whenever there's something you wanna redo
The clock is ticking, but not for me
I'm living in a different reality

Whenever, whenever, whatever
I'm right there with you

Forgot your friends birthday, just make yesterday today
Do it over till we get it fine
Will seat in the front road
Take us two what futures show, before it even happen it's hold on time

Whenever you need me, I'm right there with you
Whenever there's something you wanna redo
The clock is ticking, but not for me
I'm living in a different reality

Whenever, whenever, whatever
I'm right there with you

You miss your chance, let's talk your plans
So try it all again
It's so fun, to be someone who travels in time

Whenever you need me, I'm right there with you
Whenever there's something you wanna redo
The clock is ticking, but not for me
I'm living in a different reality

Whenever, whenever, whatever
I'm right there with you"
Pop,"You know my life is better
Standing here alone
You know I dream in colour
And do the things i want

You think you got the best of me
You think you had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that i'd come running back
Baby you don't know me, cause you're dead wrong

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes you a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean i'm over cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger.
Just me, myself and i
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone

You heard that i was starting over with someone new
They told you i was moving on, and over you

You didn't think that i'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You try to break me but you'll see

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes you a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean i'm over cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and i
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone

Thanks to you I got a new thing started
Thanks to you I'm not the broken hearted
Thanks to you I'm finally thinking 'bout me
You know in the end the day you left was just my beginning
In the end...

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes you a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean i'm over cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and i
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and i
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes you a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean i'm over cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and i
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone

I'm not alone..."
Pop,"I woke up to my world this morning
Took a long look in the looking glass
Last night I guess I had one or too many
Somebody tried to tell me I had no class

What ever happened to me
Maybe I've been living on lies
Never really had a dream come true
Then again I guess I never really tried


Now the years all slip away
And things are like they're gonna stay
All the roads I didn't take are just
One more thing in the back of my mind
Taking space and time


Wish I'd finished that book I never started
Maybe that's the story of my life
Should've learned to play that saxophone
So I could tell my song to the streetlight


Shouldn't have been so stuck on my own
Could've had a wife and a child
Should've made that house a home
I don't know why my life is so wild


Now the years all slip away
And things are like they're gonna stay
All the chances I didn't take are just
One more thing in the back of my mind
Taking space and time
One more thing in the back of my mind


So I'm thinking about a walk in the sunlight
I've got to get my shadow behind me
Try and make some sense of it all
With my feet on the ground and my heart still free


As the years will slip away
I'll let the cards fall where they may
And all the roads I didn't take will be just
One more thing in the back of my mind


As the years will slip away
And the cards fall as they may
All the chances I didn't take will be just
One more thing in the back of my mind
Taking space and time
One more thing in the back of my mind
One more thing in the back of my mind

"
Pop,"Don't you love waking up
Don't have to rush cause you ain't got much to do
Lay in bed with the TV on
All day long if you wanted to

We spend so much time, worried about what's coming up next
Can't even find a little room, a little space, even catch a breath

When life is like a hurricane
Flying off the rails like a fast train
Everything around me so insane
You come and take it all away
You're my Sunday

You show up right on time
Just when I need to take it slow
It's a mystery how easily you found the key that
always brings me home

You have a way of taking the noise and drowning it out
I don't know what I would do if I woke up and you were not around

When life is like a hurricane
Flying off the rails like a fast train
Everything around me so insane
You come and take it all away
You're my Sunday

When life is like a hurricane
Flying off the rails like a fast train
Everything around me so insane
You come and take it all away (all away)

When life is like a hurricane
Flying off the rails like a fast train
Everything around me so insane
You come take it all away
You're my Sunday
You're my Sunday
You're my Sunday

Don't you love waking up
Don't have to rush cause you ain't got much to do (hey)
Lay in bed with the TV on all day long if you wanted to"
Pop,"Rows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun
They rain and they snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way that you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
You leave 'm laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions that I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way
Oh but now old friends are acting strange
When they shake their heads and they tell me that I've changed
Well something's lost but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose but still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life
I really don't know life at all
I really don't know life
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all"
Pop,"Taking my time
Walking the line
For someone who doesn't care
Taking my time
Just walking the line
For someone who's never there

It's a fool's game--that I know
Nothing but a broken heart to show
And I know I'll never change
It's the nature of the game


She loves me--she loves me not
Remember how your heart used to stop
As the petals would hit the floor
How you wished there could be just one more

Pop,"I'm breaking down, gonna start from scratch
Shake it off like an Etch A Sketch
My lips are saying goodbye
My eyes are finally dry

I'm not the way I used to be
I took the record off repeat
You killed me but I survived
And now I'm coming alive

I'll never be that girl again
No oh oh
I'll never be that girl again
No oh oh

My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me
Miss Movin' On
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Miss Movin' On
Oh oh oh

I broke the glass that surrounded me
I ain't the way you remember me
I was such a good girl
So fragile but no more

I jumped the fence to the other side (the other side)
My whole world was electrified (electrifide)
Now I'm no longer afraid
It's Independence Day

I'll never be that girl again
No oh oh

No oh oh

My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me

Everything is changing
And I never wanna go back to the way it was
I'm finding who I am
And who I am from here on out is gonna be enough
It's gonna be enough
It's gonna be enough

Pop,"I saw you outside getting out your ride
A CLK430 you got style
As soon as I checked you out a ladies man no doubt
From head to toe your all style and I like it
How bout you buy me a rose cos I think
This is gonna get a little interesting
Lets see where this conversation goes I'm not sure that I want you to know

I wish I could right now wish that I could show you how I'm feeling you
Boy I try I can't hide how badly I want you tonight I've gotta fight it

If you take me home get me all alone
Nothing could happen it's just too soon
I'm just being upfront telling you from the jump
Not tonight I'm not that type of girl I'm sorry
If I gave you the wrong impression I apologise from the bottom of my heart
If talking out my head probably misled you
I'm confused and I'm a little scared

I wish I could right now wish that I could show you how I'm feeling you
Boy I try I can't hide how badly I want you tonight I've gotta fight it
I wish I could right now wish that I could show you how I'm feeling you
Boy I try I can't hide how badly I want you tonight I've gotta fight it

My mind its playing tricks on me I'm just not thinking clearly
This has happened too quickly I've got to slow down
Tomorrow is another day this I'll promise if you say
That it doesn't matter everything is gonna be ok

I wish I could right now wish that I could show you how I'm feeling you
Boy I try I can't hide how badly I want you tonight I've gotta fight it
I wish I could right now wish that I could show you how I'm feeling you
Boy I try I can't hide how badly I want you tonight I've gotta fight it

"
Pop,"Last night I took a walk in the snow
Couples holding hands, places to go
It seems like everyone but me is in love
Santa, can you hear me?

I signed my letter that I sealed with a kiss
I sent it off, it just said this
""I know exactly what I want this year
Santa, can you hear me? ""
I want my baby, baby ooh
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe)
You'll be all my want in a big red bow

Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year
Oh
Oh Yeah
Hmm

Christmas Eve, I just can't sleep
Would I be wrong, for takin a peek?
'Cause I heard that you're comin' to town
Santa, can you hear me?

I really hope that you're on your way
With something special for me in your sleigh
Oh please, make my wish come true
Santa, can you hear me?

I want my baby, baby, ooh
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe)
Hell be all I want, in a big red bow

Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year
Oh oh
I hope my letter reaches you in time, hmm
Bring me a love, I can call all mine, yeah, yeah
'Cause I have been so good, so good this year, oh
Can't be alone, under mistletoe
He's all I want, in a big red bow

Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year
Ahh
Oh Santa, can you hear me? Oh Santa
Cause he's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year
Oh
Oh yeah
Hmm"
Pop,"Who said I was an angel?
Who said I was an angel?

We was just a moment, nothing serious
Never really paid it no mind
Drop the back side and paying attention (Shakin' all that)
Should've never not kept your word
Woulda had a reason to keep mine
You was too inconsistent (Shakin' all that)

Should've never crossed that line with ya
Everything was cool, just drinkin' with ya
Way too young to be up in handcuffs
Wasn't tryna spend my life on the phone with ya
Gotta keep it on 100 with ya
The original me wouldn't fuck with ya
And I was beginning to fuck with ya

Who said I was an angel?
Who said I was an angel?
When you look at me, what do you see?
Open your eyes, I'm more brilliant than you'll ever be
Who said I was an angel?

Yeah, won't lie, say I don't lie
Yeah, I might've told a few lies, yeah
Won't lie, say I didn't try
But you're only worth a few tries, yeah
Track star, think you're running these streets
You ain't the only one running the streets
They making ground like they only wear cleats, yeah

Should've never crossed that line with ya
Everything was cool, just drinkin' with ya
Way too young to be up in handcuffs
Wasn't tryna spend my life on the phone with ya
Gotta keep it all 100 with ya
The original me wouldn't fuck with ya
And I was beginning to fuck with ya

Who said I was an angel?
(But you was wrong)
Who said I was an angel?
(I'm no angel, when you look at me)
When you look at me, what do you see? (What do you see?)
Open your eyes, I'm more brilliant than you'll ever be
Who said I was an angel? (Who said I was an angel?)

Who said I was an angel? (Who said I was an angel?)
Don't know who I'll be, I'm far from an angel
Who said I was an angel?
Never took the time out, never had time to figure me out
When you look at me
When you look at me, what do you see, what do you see?
Open your eyes, I'm more brilliant than you'll ever be
Who said I was an angel? (Who said I was a, an angel?)"
Pop,"Thoughts about you and me Thinkin' about what we used to be
Love was strong so were we Until one day it all went wrong

A new body a new face
But no one good enough to fill your empty space
Baby where did our love go
I'm thinkin' about you and me now
Baby both you and I should know
We should know by now
Warming heat coolin' shade Whatever I needed I found in the love we made
Maybe this was meant to be Miss and reminisce of something close to exctasy

But I still hope that you feel our love inside the way I do

Chorus

Thoughts about you and me Thinkin' about what used to be
"
Pop,"Hey you beautiful
Hey you beautiful

Hey you beautiful, girl you knock me down
Haven't seen you before, try to feel you out
Die hard, disregard, coming out your mouth
But your body saying something else

You say that you don't, don't

Pop,"I'm layin' it
On the line to show you
I'll never let you go
On the line for your love
There's nothing I want more

Another dead-end street, another love gone wrong
Another shattered dream, always the same old song
I started thinking that, you'll never come along

I got all this love inside, that so low was denied
I wish you knew what I've been through to get to you

I'm layin' it
On the line to show you
I'll never let you go
On the line for your love
There's nothing I want more
When you smile, I feel my heart open
And I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do
I'm layin' it
On the line this time
Just to be with you

After everything my heart's been through
I treasure every moment I spend with you
for me to feel this way is something new

Now it's got ahold of me, it's making me believe
That what we've got is something unlike any other

I'm layin' it
On the line to show you
I'll never let you go
On the line for your love
There's nothing I want more
When you smile, I feel my heart open
And I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do
I'm layin' it
On the line this time
Just to be with you

* If you're thinking what I'm thinking
* All you gotta do is say the word (say the word)
* If you tell me what you're needing
* I can give you what you're asking for (asking for)

Well I didn't have a prayer, I thought nobody cared
Turned around and you were there

I have been waiting for you (waiting for you baby)
And I want you to know (I want you to know)

On the line to show you
That I'll never let you go
On the line for your love
There's nothing I want more
When you smile, I feel my heart open
And I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do (nothing that I wouldn't
do)

I'm layin' it
On the line to show you
Never gonna let you go, never gonna let you go
On the line for your love
There's nothing I want more
When you smile, I feel my heart open
And I know there's nothing that I would not do
I'm layin' it
On the line this time
Just to be with you
"
Pop,"Standing on a ledge, looking down
Somebody shouting ""Don't jump, don't hit the ground""
Standing here closer to the moon
Get my halo ready
Don't worry, I'll be there soon

Somewhere up ahead I hear it coming
Like a bullet to the brain
Somewhere in the crowd I feel the loving
Will we ever be the same?

I'm a superstar
I'm a superstar
I'm a superstar
It's gonna be a long way down

Lying on train track, ooh, there's a train coming
Faster than a hurricane
Don't mind me, look away, I'm the stranger
No one knew that I could save the day

Put me on a list, my name and number
Tell them that I've come so far
Gonna be as loud as rain and thunder
And now I'm ready for the stars

I'm a superstar
I'm a superstar
I'm a superstar
It's gonna be a long way down

Can you see me right now?
Can you hear me right now?
Can you see me right now?
Gonna have my fifteen minutes of fame
Gonna have so much fun playing the game
'Cause I'm a superstar
I'm a superstar
Gonna sign my name on a photograph
Oh this champagne life no it ain't so bad
'Cause I'm a superstar
Yeah, I'm a superstar

(Superstar)
(Superstar)
'Cause I'm a superstar
(It's gonna be a long way down)
Gonna have my fifteen minutes of fame
Gonna have so much fun playing the game
'Cause I'm a superstar
It's gonna be a long way down"
Pop,"Baby says no
She can't let go this soon
Doesn't feel right
Not tonight
Even though I gave her the stars and the moon
I really think I've got it bad this time around

Baby says yes
But I must confess
It really doesn't seem to matter
'Cause I'd follow that girl all around the world
Even if I never had her
I really think I've got it bad this time around

Gonna show 'em what love can do
Gonna tell 'em 'bout me and you
Gonna show 'em what love can do when it's right
And this time it's right

Love is the light that can shine so bright
But sometimes it fades away
Then you find one that can shine like the sun
And she comes up for you every day
I really think I've got it bad this time around

Oh when the girl is so far away
I can't think of all the right words to say
But now she's here and we are all together"
Pop,"Oh, I'm sittin' on a sofa, feeling wasted
And without you here I am suffocating
Ooh, somethin' 'bout your body got me racing
I'll be alright
I'll be alright, yeah

The air is thin tell you're on me
Every breath that feels on me
Tell we're numb in our bodies
And I don't feel a thing

Only you save me
I wanna breathe you in
I need your oxygen, oh baby (oh baby)
The way your lips taste it
You gotta let me in
'Cause I need your oxygen, oh baby

I'll breathe you out, I'll breathe you in
Until we start back up again
I'll breathe you out, I'll breathe you in
Until we start back up again
'Cause you're my oxygen

I can smell your perfume on my T-shirt
Oh, skin to skin and underneath ya
So-oh, stay like this, don't move an inch, I need ya
I'll be alright
I'll be alright, yeah
I said that I'll be alright

The air is thin tell you're on me
Every breath that feels on me
Tell we're numb in our bodies
And I don't feel a thing

Only you save me
I wanna breathe you in
I need you, oxygen, oh baby (oh baby)
The way your lips taste it
You gotta let me in
'Cause I need your oxygen, oh baby

I'll breathe you out, I'll breathe you in
Until we start up again
I'll breathe you out, I'll breathe you in
Until we start back up again
'Cause you're my oxygen

You know I need you, baby
I can feel you, baby
You know that I breathe you in
You know I need you, baby

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uhh

Only you save me

I'll breathe you out, I'll breathe you in
Until we start up again
I'll breathe you out, I'll breathe you in
Until we start back up again
'Cause you're my oxygen"
Pop,"It was on a cold December day
When Joseph carried a baby away
To a place for the savior to be born, oh
He couldn't find no place to rest
She bore, yes she did, she bore the pain
A little child, oh Jesus, truly had to be born

I heard him say: there ain't no room at the inn
No room at the inn, there ain't no room at the inn
There ain't no room at the inn, there ain't no room at the inn
For your child (room at the inn)
To be born (room at the inn)
Ohh (room at the inn)
You know we traveled through the night
Storm and rain, oh yes it was
The little child, oh Jesus, truly had to be born

Joseph he trembled all through the night
Nobody but Joseph and his little darlin' wife
I said, there were three, three wise men comin' from afar
Bible tells me they were guided by the stars
Till they fell down to worship this holy one

I heard them say 'there ain't no room at the inn'
No room at the inn, there ain't no room at the inn
There ain't no room at the inn, there ain't no room at the inn
For your child (room at the inn)
To be born (room at the inn)
Ohh (room at the inn)
You know we traveled through the night
Storm and rain, oh yes it was
The little child, oh Jesus, truly had to be born

You know I heard them say 'there ain't no room at the inn'
No room at the inn, there ain't no room at the inn
There ain't no room at the inn, there ain't no room at the inn
For your child (room at the inn)
To be born (room at the inn)
Ohh (room at the inn)
Through the night
Storm and rain, oh yes it was
The little child, oh Jesus, truly had to be born
The little child, oh Jesus, truly had to be born
Oh little child, oh Jesus, truly had to be born"
Pop,"If I could be just one thing
I would be what you're craving
Six foot three with steel blue eyes
Sweep you off of your feet before you count to five
But the truth is I am just a man
Standing five foot ten doing the best I can
And I've lived long enough to see
You will never be craving me

Oh whoa
I watched her go
After she planted her love in the top soil
And from the top soil an iris bloomed
It was pretty in May, but it died in June

If I could sing the way I feel inside
It'd sound happy and sad at the same damn time
'Cause when you smiled at me on that dance floor
It was the prettiest mask that you ever wore

Oh whoa
I watched her go
After she planted her love in the top soil
And from the top soil an iris bloomed
It was pretty in May, but it died in June

Pop,"Wise men say, only fools rush in
But I can't help, falling in love with you
Shall I stay? Would it be a sin
If I can't help, falling in love with you?

Like a river flows, surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes somethings are meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can't help, falling in love with you

Like a river flows, surely to the sea
Darling so it goes, somethings are meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you

We were never growing old
And the glitter was still gold
The way it used to be
It was love
It was easy just to smile
It was easy for a while
The way it used to be

Even stars they fade
And colors turn to grey
I miss yesterday
And the way it used to be
And I can't turn back time
Even if I tried
I miss you tonight
And girl, I miss the way it used to be

Look at you
You got the life, the pretty house
But you must still think about
The way it used to be
Is it real?
He don't love you like I do
Can we just go back to
The way it used to be

Even stars they fade
And colors turn to grey
I miss yesterday
And the way it used to be
And I can't turn back time
Even if I tried
I miss you tonight
And girl, I miss the way it used to be

And girl, I miss the way

Look at us
Just look what we've become
Just a shell of what was once
The way it used to be

Even stars they fade
And colors turn to grey
I miss yesterday
And the way it used to be
And I can't turn back time
Even if I tried
I miss you tonight

You're here, you're willing and able
Do you really understand the challenge you've set yourself
You know I want to adore you
Can't believe how life was before you
I must apologize, please understand I'm so demanding

Don't need to be cruel
I never felt that with you
Trouble is I'm a danger to myself
Don't want to push you away
I really want you to stay
Until I figure this out, won't you

Please, come take me over
Let me leave me for awhile
Maybe when I'm older
I'll understand the reason why
Understand the reason why

Every day is here to remind me
That the past is always behind me
Something I can never change
But I won't let it hold me back
You arrived just in time
Now I know I'll be fine
I'm not ashamed to say
You truly are my inspiration

Don't need to be cruel
I never felt that with you
Trouble is I'm a danger to myself
Don't want to push you away
I really want you to stay
Until I figure this out, won't you

Please, come take me over
Let me leave me for awhile
Maybe when I'm older
I'll understand the reason why
Understand the reason why

Might not be forever
Baby whatever
We've got today, won't you

Please, come take me over
Let me leave me for awhile
Maybe when I'm older

So don't let go, let go of me
Don't let go, let go of me
Ay ay ay, aye
I just can't stop dancing

Again now
Spin around now
Down now, to the floor now

Your mind is going places I can feel
That further lets me know this is real
And I won't stop, you know I like it there
You can even go further babe
Cause nothing's forbidden
Don't be scared, no worries
Once I'm there, all is forgiven
So be prepared
To come and push up on my

Ay ay ay, aye
Just can't stop dancing
Ay ay ay, aye
Don't wanna chance it
So don't let go, let go of me
Don't let go, let go of me
Ay ay ay, aye
I just can't stop dancing

Again now
Spin around now
Down now, to the floor now

Believe it, I feel it
It's in the air
Although you can't see you know it's there
My heart keeps on racing, in overdrive
Once the music hits my body I feel so alive
And it's alright
It's got me like

Ay ay ay, aye
Just can't stop dancing
Ay ay ay, aye
Don't wanna chance it
So don't let go, let go of me
Don't let go, let go of me
Ay ay ay, aye
I just can't stop dancing

Ay ay ay, aye
Just can't stop dancing
Ay ay ay, aye
I don't wanna chance it
So don't let go, let go of me
Don't let go, let go of me
Ay ay ay, aye
I just can't stop dancing"
Pop,"The loser's out
Word is on the street
That I've been dancing to a brand new beat
You had your chance to
Sweep me off my feet
But I don't need you to make me complete
Now I'm gone
So good to be gone

You're looking at me like I'm from outer space
Well allow me to wipe that smile
Right off of your face
Whatever you thought was
Simply not the case
'Cause I'm out of your reach
And I'm so out of this place
And I'm gone
So good, so good to be gone

Yeah, so good to be gone
So good to be gone
Yeah, so good to be gone
So good to be gone

So now there's something
You wanna get off of your chest
And now you're sorry for
Making such a mess
And you may still love me
But I couldn't care less
Cause that was some other girl
In some other red dress
And I'm gone
So good to be
So good to be gone

Yeah, so good to be gone
So good to be gone
Yeah, so good to be gone
So good to be gone

Yeah, so good to be gone
So good to be gone
Yeah, so good to be gone
So good to be gone

You never thought
I'd break the spell that I was under
You never thought
I'd be as loud as thunder
You never imagined
How the tables could turn
Turn the light my man
Time to watch you burn

Yeah, so good to be gone
So good to be gone
Yeah, so good to be gone
So good to be gone

Yeah, so good to be gone
So good to be gone
Yeah, so good to be gone
So good to be gone"
Pop,"Everyone maybe once or twice
Finds a friend that's a friend for life
Somebody who believed in me like you
From those days of childhood fights
Through the nights when we'd ask advice
All of those times when nobody else would do

Any old time that you wanna hear from me
To find your way or kick around a memory
Like the old times
Any old time will do


I can tell when the telephone rings
It's gonna be you just to talk about things
It's funny how it seems to happen when you're on my mind
Every time good love goes bad
When I can't believe the luck I've had
All of those times I'm glad you're a friend of mine


Any old time that you need to call on me
To find your way or kick around those memories
Like the old times
Any old time will do


Don't you ever forget
Any old time when the road is getting rough to climb
And you think maybe you've had enough
Just like the old times
Any old time you're blue


All at once I went and got a hunch
Everything we ever felt was true
As we find the years behind us and we live the years ahead
Let's remember laughter and all the words we said


Make new friends and keep the old
One is silver and the other one's gold
Something Sally said that stuck in my head
And I never wanna let it go


Any old time that you need to lean on me
I'll be there -- you can dream on me
Just like the old times
Any old time will do

Pop,"What's sweet about sweet sixteen
When you're alone?
It's Saturday night (it's Saturday night)
The moon is so bright (the moon is so bright)
And I've got no one of my own

What's sweet about sweet sixteen
When no one's there?
I'm all by myself (I'm all by myself)
Like a doll on a shelf (like a doll on the shelf)
Who is oh, oh so lost to share

Friends all send me
Presents and flowers
Greeting cards engraved in gold
But what I really
Want for my birthday
Is someone that I can hold

What's sweet about sweet sixteen?
I'm so alone
There's one thing to do (there's one thing to do)
Go to sleep feeling blue (go to sleep feeling blue)
'Cause I've got no one of my own

(sweet sixteen)

There's one thing to do (there's one thing to do)
Go to sleep feeling blue (go to sleep feeling blue)
'Cause I've got no one of my own
Oh No no no no no one on my own
Oh no no no no no one on my one"

Pop,"I wish Tracy Chapman was my friend
She would know exactly what to say
Beginnings always hide themselves in ends
At some point, I will be okay

I got high when I met you
I got high to forget you
I feel pain, I don't want to
But I have to, yeah, I have to

If I want to move on, move on, move on, move on
If I want to move on, move on, move on, move on
If I want to move on (Move on) , move on (Move on)
Move on (Move on) , move on
If I want to move on (Move on) , move on (Move on)
Move on (Move on) , move on

Went to see some shaman in Malay
To hear some things I wanted to hear
Everyone just wants to feel good
Everyone just wants to disappear
Call up girls that live in my hometown
To help fill up the minutes
Lit a match and saged my house down
It didn't make a difference

So I got high when I met you
I got high to forget you
I feel pain, I don't want to
But I have to, yeah, I have to

If I want to move on, move on, move on, move on
If I want to move on, move on, move on, move on
If I want to move on (Move on) , move on (Move on)
Move on (Move on) , move on
I know I got to move on (Move on) , move on (Move on)
Move on (Move on) , move on"
Pop,"Sunny, stay by me.

Rain used to fill my eyes
till I met you, Sunny.
You cleared my cloudy skies
pretty little Sunny.
You made the rain disappear,
it's just like magic when I hold you near.
Oh Sunny, stay by me.

I never wore a smile
till the day I found you.
Now all I do is smile
whenever I'm around you.
It's such a wonderful world,
say that you'll always be my sunshine girl.
Sunny stay by me.

My life was sad and lonely,
I never saw the sun.
But the very moment that I held you tight
I walked out of the darkness and into the light.

I love no one but you,
Sunny, please believe me.
Don't ever say we're through,
Sunny never leave me.
Promise you won't go away,
love me for ever as you do today.
Oh Sunny, stay by me."
Pop,"Yo, dreams we all have'em

Wake up in the morning
Still in my pijamas
Roll up to the game
Hotter than the sauna
I was maybe

Focused to the bone
Thought I use some
Had a few fases
I got different things to make
Got my squad

I got all the time that I need, yo, yo
Listing to Panda got me beep, yo, yo
Pencil in my hand, I'm the man, yo, yo
Red and green, number nineteen

Dreams, dreams, dreams, yeah
They are good for your heart
The more that you love it
The sooner you'll start it
Ain't never gonna stop me from making this art
I gotta be on point, like I'm a dart

I've got a power in me
Stronger than electricity
I gotta dream in me
That I'm gonna achieve
My momma told me
In what to belive
They wanna stop me
In what I belive

Haters gonna hate
Lovers gonna love
Ignoring what they say
I fly past you like I'm dove
I'm just doing me
That's what I love"
Pop,"Watch the first light
Kiss the new world
It's a wonder, baby like you and I
All the colours of the rainbow
Going somewhere, baby like you and I

It's gonna be alright
But when my sky clouds over

(Lift me up) when the day is over
(Take me up) when the sun is going down
(Show me love) and I'll be your angel now
(Lift me up) when the lights are fading
(Talk me down) when I'm flying way up high
(Show me love) and I'll be your angel for life
Your angel for life

Like the seasons ever changing
Everlasting baby like you and I
It's gonna be alright
But when my sky clouds over

CHORUS

No matter where we run
Who knows what we will become
Is there a world we know
Where life will naturally

CHORUS"
Pop,"I used to think that happiness
Was feeling like you finally won
I couldn't rest knowing someone else
Might be out there having more fun

More pressure, more time
Do everything right
Don't smile, don't care
Don't waste your Friday night
Look perfect, stand still
Blend in, don't lose the fight

Sometimes it's easy to get carried away
Listening to the things that people say
Feeling like nobody's got your back
But everything you need is everything you have

Ooh...

I used to think that beautiful
Was looking like a perfect 10
I couldn't see I was good enough
Couldn't get past everything they said

More pressure, more time
Do everything right
Don't smile, don't care
Don't waste your Friday night
Look perfect, stand still
Blend in, don't lose the fight

Sometimes it's easy to get carried away
Listening to the things that people say
Feeling like nobody's got your back
But everything you need is everything you have
Looking all around, can't you feel the pain?
Talking like they know but they don't know a thing
You can leave tonight and never look back
Cause everything you need is everything you have

Ooh...
Ooh...

Sometimes it's easy to get carried away
You listen to the things that people say
Feeling like nobody's got your back
But everything you need is everything you have

Looking all around, can't you feel the pain?
Talking like they know but they don't know a thing
You can leave tonight and never look back
Cause everything you need is everything you have
Sometimes it's easy to get carried away
Listening to the things that people say
Feeling like nobody's got your back
But everything you need is everything you have
Looking all around, can't you feel the pain?
Talking like they know but they don't know a thing
You can leave tonight and never look back
Cause everything you need is everything you have"
Pop,"Feeling like I'm breathing my last breath
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears I've wept
Look at all the promises that I've kept

I put my heart into your hands
Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reach

And you bless me with the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You've given me purpose

Thinking my journey's come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, for inner peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent
my spirit's at ease

I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter when, wherever I am
You're not hard to reach

And you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way

Oh, you are my everything
Oh, you are my everything"
Pop,"If you ever been in love
Then you know just what I'm talking about
Its like when you really know
You finally found the person you want
And you wanna spend the rest of your life
I thought I've been there before
But now that I'm sure,
I finally found somebody who cares
I've given my heart and my soul to her
And I just want the whole world to know

[Chorus]
Yu're the reason that I breathe
I want you to know that
If you were to leave, then I couldn't go back
My life will be incomplete without you here
You're the reason that I breathe
Ladies if you got a man
Fellas if you got a girl
Why don't you tell em that they mean the whole world
To you,you,you,you
You're the reason that I breathe

The feeling you get when you call them
And they don't answer and feels like
You're whole world's about to stop(stop)
And you can't believe somehow,
Somebody makes you feel this way
I'm talking about you can't eat(eat)
You can't sleep(sleep)
You cant breathe at all
They're like the puzzle thats been missing in your life
Why don't you look em in they eye and tell them

[Chorus]
You're the reason that I breathe
I want you to know that
If you were to leave, then I couldn't go back
My life will be incomplete without you here
You're the reason that I breathe
Ladies if you got a man
Fellas if you got a girl
Why don't you tell em that they mean the whole world
To you,you,you,you
You're the reason that I breathe

[Bridge]
I was broken before I met you
Now I ain't trippin like I used to
And I gotta say
That you made my life much better
I can barely breathe, I can barely breathe
When your not with me (ohhh)

[Chorus]
You're the reason that I breathe
I want you to know that
If you were to leave, then I couldn't go back
My life will be incomplete without you here
You're the reason that I breathe x2

If you got a man uhh, if you got a girl
Why dont you tell em that they mean the whole world
To you, you, you, you (woaah)
If theres somebody out there, just like me
Put your hands up and tell her
You're the reason that I breathe"

Pop,"(Elliot Wolff)

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh oh oh
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules
Oh oh oh
Girl don't play the fool--no

You're the one givin' up the love
Anytime he needs it
But you turn your back and then he's off
and runnin' with the crowd
You're the one to sacrifice
Anything to please him
Do you really think he thinks about you
when he's out

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh oh oh
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules
Oh oh oh
Girl don't play the fool--no

It was only late last night
He was out there sneakin'
Then he called you up to check that you
were waiting by the phone
All the world's a candy store
He's been trick or treatin'
When it comes to true love girl with him
there's no one home

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh oh oh
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules
Oh oh oh
Girl don't play the fool--no

You could find somebody better girl
He could only make you cry
You deserve somebody better girl
He's c-cold as ice

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh oh oh
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules
Oh oh oh
Girl don't play the fool--no

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh oh oh
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules
Oh oh oh
Girl don't play the fool--(repeat to fade)

Rap:
How come how come
he can he can tell-a tell-a you're-a you're-a
Always always number number one without a doubt
(He's he's one one cold cold snake snake)
When-a when-a
he is he is always always squirmin' squirmin'
Like a little snake under-a e-ver-y-a rock
(No no give give, all all take take)
You've been you've been workin' workin' on the on the love
And he's been only only playing
undercover all the while
(One one smooth smooth sharp sharp tongue tongue)
Take a take another 'nother look into his eyes
(He he just just talks)
And you will only see a reptile"
Pop,"Only one way to describe, this is deceit I am hiding
Never been here before, never wanna see here again
I've strayed from a long-term lover
And found greater lust from another
My conscience is keeping me awake and shouting at me all night

So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late

Being loved is a big responsibility
You can never give too much back
You know it's so easy to walk away and leave that little lady flat
My life's feeling crowded with possessions, am I lucky or sad
Is it time to turn away and lose everything I had

Moving in circles, decisions chasing me round and round
Why's life never easy, or do we make it hard for ourselves
And when we find love, we need to look for something new
'Cos when it's all over you always feel the need to be loved
Like she used to love you
"
Pop,"Oh my mama told me
’cause she say she learned the hard way
Say she wanna spare the children
She say don’t give or sell your soul away
’cause all that you have is your soul
Don’t be tempted by the shiny apple
Don’t you eat of a bitter fruit
Hunger only for a taste of justice
Hunger only for a world of truth
’cause all that you have is your soul

I was a pretty young girl once
I had dreams I had high hopes
I married a man he stole my heart away
He gave his love but what a high price I paid
And all that you have is your soul

Why was I such a young fool
Thought I’d make history
Making babies was the best I could do
Thought I’d made something that could be mine forever
Found out the hard way one can’t possess another
And all that you have is your soul

I thought thought that I could find a way
To beat the system
To make a deal and have no debts to pay
I’d take it all take it all I’d run away
Me for myself first class and first rate
But all that you have is your soul

Here I am waiting for a better day
A second chance
A little luck to come my way
A hope to dream a hope that I can sleep again
And wake in the world with a clear conscience and clean hands
’cause all that you have is your soul

All that you have
All that you have
All that you have
Is your soul"
Pop,"I'm a human being
And so are you

No peace of mind, but don't shut me out
You know we're the same kind
A dying race

Fall deep in the slap and we looking for some more
Let it go, roll up some more, pour up some more
After this I'ma be laid on the floor
Wasted, but it's so good when you taste it
I'm addicted to this shit, might as well face it

Pop,"I'm ashamed of you
Don't know how you don't feel it too
You cannot do anything right
Don't know why you are still alive
I'd like to know: why do you still try?
You will never win this fight
Oh really, do you think you're good?
Why would anyone like you?
You have to mature
Why don't you do like I do?

[Chorus]
I just want the best for you
But you must follow what I choose
If you think differently
Hide your thoughts
You have to act like me
All I say is just concern
But time will make you learn
This is the script
Just follow what I decided you'll be

You're not good enough
But you must be used to being rebuff
Don't you think you need to change?
The way you are, you're out of place
Why don't you give up?
You are a problem for anyone
You're fucking ugly, boring and silly
No one cares how you are feeling
You have to understand
You just fail over and over again

Chorus

I know you heard some of these things
I know you thought it (it) was true
No one knows the pain that words can bring
Until they are turned against you
I know you might be wanting to help
But this way you're only making me worse
There are things I can't do for myself
So just help me up

Chorus"
Pop,"Maybe you're out tonight
With somebody else by your side
Oh oh oh oh
You forgot about me, yeah
And I guess you're moving on
You got sick of me like a song
Oh oh oh oh

While you're living the good life
I feel a sharp knife
Stabbing me straight through the heart

You gotta know that I'm here all alone
Wondering if you feel this low
As I do without you oh oh oh oh
In case you didn't know
Since you left I've been miserable
Why did you have to go oh oh?

So I dated other girls yeah
I tried everything in the world
Oh oh oh oh
To forget your face
Why would anyone stick around
When I get up screaming out
At the worst time
Your name

That's while you're living the good life
I feel a sharp knife
Stabbing me straight through the heart

You gotta know that I'm here all alone
Wondering if you feel this low
As I do without you oh oh oh oh
In case you didn't know
Since you left I've been miserable
Why did you have to go oh oh?

Can you hear me when I say
I really need you
I really want you
Oh oh oh oh
In case you didn't know
I really miss you
I really need you
Oh oh oh oh
In case you didn't know

Don't even know if you care
That I'm waiting right here
Unable to make one move
Still waiting for you to call
Banging my head against the wall
I'm so hopeless without you

I'm here all alone
Wondering if you feel this low
As I do without you oh oh oh oh
In case you didn't know
Since you left I've been miserable
Why did you have to go oh oh?

Can you hear me when I say
I really need you
I really want you
Oh oh oh oh
In case you didn't know
I really need you
I really want you
Oh oh oh oh
In case you didn't know
In case you didn't know
In case you didn't know"
Pop,"I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Tell me that you're home, what a beautiful lie
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you

Won't say I'm yours, won't say I'm not
I'm somewhere between, while you're at the bar downtown
It's been a month and we're getting close
But not close enough, to love you or hate you now
In the morning, you look like an angel
But the devil's buying you a table
Serving a drink, you're making your rounds
Picture it all, I'm out of my mind right now

And everybody told me, so I

I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Tell me that you're home, what a beautiful lie
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
I know that you think I don't
The pictures you had, the numbers in your phone
I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you

And everybody told me, so I

I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Tell me that you're home, what a beautiful lie
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
I know that you think I don't
The pictures you have, the numbers in your phone
I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you

And everybody told me, but I
I had to see it with my own eyes

I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Tell me that you're home, what a beautiful lie
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
I know that you think I don't (I know that you think I don't)
The pictures you have, the numbers in your phone
I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you

Ahh, yeah
Ahh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Ahh"
Pop,"Though we may fight
Most every night
I'll meet you in the middle some day
The heartaches thrive
But the love survives
I'll meet you in the middle some day

People are known to be reckless
To never let go of their pride
But honey I believe we've been careless
Cause the damage just can't be denied

Oh, before we start
We're miles apart
And there's a million reasons why
But I wake to find
You're still on my mind
It's stronger as the years go by

I'd like to sit down with you darlin'
Show you everything in my heart
But emotions run high when I see your face
I just don't know where to start

Oh, I'll meet you in the middle some day
Oh, I'll meet you in the middle some day

Mm, if all for this
Just one more kiss
I'd travel any distance to find
Your eyes of coal
Your secret soul
I swear that I could read your mind

Honey you can call me crazy
To think that our affection could last
But I see us throw it all together
After all the storms have passed

Oh, though we may fight
Most every night
I'll meet you in the middle some day
The heartaches thrive
But the love survives
I'll meet you in the middle some day

Oh, I'll meet you in the middle some day
Oh, I'll meet you in the middle some day
Some day"
Pop,"Today this could be, the greatest day of our lives
Before it all ends, before we run out of time
Stay close to me, stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me

Tonight this could be the greatest night of our lives
Let’s make a new start, The future is ours to find
Can you see it, can you see it in my eyes
Can you feel it now, can you hold it in your arms tonight
Hold on hold on, hold on hold on (tonight)
Hold on hold on

Stay close to me (hold on)
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
stay closes me

Hold your head high (hold on)
Arms open wide
Yeah the world starts to come alive when you stay close it me

Today this could be the greatest day of our lives
Today this could be the greatest day of our lives

Oh and the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
And the would comes alive

Stay close to me (and the world comes alive) hold on
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive)
Watch the world come alive tonight stay close to me (hold on)
Stay cloes to me and the world comes alive
Stay close to me and the world comes alive
Watch the world come alive tonight (stay close to me)"
Pop,"Ooh, ooh
Hey, yeah, mm

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a yеar, it doesn't surprise me

Mеrry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you"", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kiss me now, I know you'll fool me again, oh

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Oh, Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in her heart
A woman under cover but you tore me apart
Ooh-ooh-ooh
And now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again, oh

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)
But the very next day you gave it away (Oh, you gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'm gon' give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special, special

A face on a lover with a fire in her heart
A woman under cover but you tore him apart
I'll give it to someone special, I'll give it to someone special
Ooh-ooh, oh
I'll give it to someone special, special
MM"
Pop,"See I never thought that I could walk through fire.
I never thought that I could take the burn.
I never had the strength to take it higher,
Until I reached the point of no return.

And there's just no turning back,
When your heart's under attack,
Gonna give everything I have,
It's my destiny.

I will never say never! (I will fight)
I will fight till forever! (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down,
I will not stay on the ground.
Pick it up,
Pick it up,
Pick it up,
Pick it up up up,
And never say never.

I never thought I could feel this power.
I never thought that I could feel this free.
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower.
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea.

And there's just no turning back,
When your heart's under attack,
Gonna give everything I have,
Cause this is my destiny.

I will never say never! (I will fight)
I will fight till forever! (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down,
I will not stay on the ground.
Pick it up,
Pick it up,
Pick it up,
Pick it up, up, up,
And never say never.

Here we go!
Guess who?
JSmith and Jb!
I gotcha lil bro.
I can handle him.
Hold up, aight?
I can handle him.

Now he's bigger than me,
Taller than me.
And he's older than me,
And stronger than me.
And his arms a little bit longer than me.
But he ain't on a JB song with me!

I be trying a chill
They be trying to side with the thrill.
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will.

Like Luke with the force, when push comes to shove.
Like Cobe with the 4th, ice water with blood.

I gotta be the best, and yes
We're the flyest.
Like David and Goliath,
I conquered the giant.
So now I got the world in my hand,
I was born from two stars
So the moon's where I land.

I will never say never! (I will fight)
I will fight till forever! (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down,
I will not stay on the ground.
Pick it up,
Pick it up,
Pick it up,
Pick it up, up, up,
And never say never.

I will never say never! (I will fight)
I will fight till forever! (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down,
I will not stay on the ground.
Pick it up,
Pick it up,
Pick it up,
Pick it up, up, up,
And never say never."
Pop,"I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you

Old friend
Why are you so shy
It ain't like you to hold back
Or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I hoped you'd see my face
and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead

You'd know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summery haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over yet

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg, I remembered you said
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead"
Pop,"Hey, what did I do?
Can't believe the fit I just threw
Stupid
Wanted the reaction

I remember the words
How I said them, so they would hurt
But then, I regret my actions

If I could press rewind
Rewind the take
Redefine the line
We make mistakes
Take it back in time,
Just one day ... hey

So all I need is a time machine
A one way track cause
I'm taking it back, taking it back
All I want is a Delorean
If I could go just like that
I'll be taking it back, taking it back

Yeah who's laughing now?
Didn't think you'd actually go
Stupid
Me and all my bitching

Second thoughts and regrets
Wanna alt delete and reset but then
This ain't science fiction

If I could press rewind
Rewind the take
Redefine the line
We make mistakes
Take it back in time,
Just one day ... hey

So all I need is a time machine
A one way track cause
I'm taking it back, taking it back
All I want is a Delorean
If I could go just like that
I'll be taking it back, taking it back

So all I need is a time machine
A one way track cause
I'm taking it back, taking it back
All I want is a Delorean
If I could go just like that
I'll be taking it back, taking it back"
Pop,"Turn your radio up, turn your radio up
Turn your radio up, turn your radio up

Ain't no other shawty I've heard of baby
Put a million on that that that that
I took my world and gave you half of it baby
I pray I'll never get it back back back back

I love your style
I love your smile
I love your eyes
They look like diamonds to me
But you could have it all
All of it baby
In your favorite store blowin' stacks stacks stacks

Because I know that all my dreams

I'll never feel the way I feel girl
With you oh baby you yeah you

I'll go up and get a star for you baby
Pick it out and bring it back back back back
I'm glad you opened up your heart for me baby
I ain't lying that's a fact fact fact fact

I remember us sitting up late in my one bedroom apartment
Memories runnin' thru my head head head head
You the only one I want if you were to leave me
I don't know what I would do instead stead stead stead

Cus I love ya I love ya
Even if I'm tempted I swear
I'll never put none of them other above ya
Hoping I can get along with your big brothers
Cus I'm in it for the long hard
Like truckers
Party in love, purple label kisses

And I'll be making you my Mrs
We can look exquisite, trips to the pacific
Look up in the sky like look Mèma I did it

Pop,"I live for love, and all it brings
The heart it heals the song it sings
The sweetest kiss, the warm embrace
Will melt the ice before it breaks

No matter what I do, no matter what I say
What can I do when nothing stays the same
It's written in the stars, the story ends the same
Everything changes

Love never loved me
Love left me out in the cold
Love never loved me
Love gave up on me after all

I've taken chances, set them free
I've taken back virginity
I've been adored, I've been the one
I've broken hearts, I've had my fun

No matter what I do, no matter what I say
What can I do when nothing stays the same
It's written in the stars, the story ends the same
Everything changes

Love never loved me
Love left me out in the cold
Love never loved me
Love gave up on me after all

You can't break a heart that's already broken
You can't steal a heart that's already stolen
And what doesn't kill me is making me strong
I'm ready for love

You can't break a heart that's already broken
You can't steal a heart that's already stolen
And what doesn't kill me is making me strong
I'm ready for love

Love never loved me

You can't break a heart that's already broken
You can't steal a heart that's already stolen
My greatest desire is to love and be loved
Cos I'm a believer I'm not giving up
And what doesn't kill me is making me strong
I'm waiting, I'm willing, I'm ready for love

Love never loved me
Love left me out in the cold
Love never loved me
Love gave up on me after all
Love never loved me (love never loved me)
Love left me out in the cold
Love never loved me (love never loved me)
Love gave up on me after all
Love never loved me (love never loved me)"
Pop,"I get into my car
Turn the radio on
Drive by your house, your window, your bed
Since we’ve been over and done
Ah, but your voice is still ringin’ in my head

Who divided up the days into hours
The hours into minutes
How could they really be that smart?
Who divided up the minutes into seconds?
They must’ve had a broken heart
Must’ve had a broken heart

I saw you way up town
Another girl by your side
I knew by your smile she was more than just a friend
I’m gonna bury my head in the comfort so deeper
Knowin’ I’ll never feel your arms again

Who divided up the days into hours
The hours into minutes
How could they really be that smart?
Who divided up the minutes into seconds?
They must’ve had a broken heart
Must’ve had a broken heart

It’s when love is over you’re gonna learn about time
You’re gonna fight and scheme
You’re gonna weep and moan
You’re gonna wonder why, why, why, why

It’s 3 AM says the clock on the wall
Here is the dark of the night the world stands still
I’m reaching for the phone, that old number to call
Oh, but I know I can’t stand to feel that chill

Who divided up the days into hours
The hours into minutes
How could they really be that smart?
Who divided up the minutes into seconds?
They must’ve had a broken heart
Must’ve had a broken heart

Who divided up the days into hours
The hours into minutes
How could they really be that smart?
Who divided up the minutes into seconds?
They must’ve had a broken heart
Must’ve had a broken heart

Who divided up the days into hours
The hours into minutes
How could they really be that smart?
Who divided up the minutes into seconds?
They must’ve had a broken heart
Must’ve had a broken heart

Oh, they must’ve had a broken heart
They must have, must have, must have had a broken heart"
Pop,"[Mike Posner:]
She packed my bags last night pre-flight
Zero hour nine AM.
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the earth so much I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no I'm a rocket man
And all this science I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
You don't wanna be high
High like me

[Chorus:]
I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no I'm a rocket man

Eh, eh I'm a rocket man
Yeah I'm a rocket man
I'm a rocket man

[Bun B:]
Huston we got some problems
I don't know how your boy gonna solve them
The command center just won't leak
And it counts us down
I don't know what to think
Happening in a blink
Sorta like the big Bang
How did something so small
Urn in to a big thing
One small move turn in to a big chain
Don't waste no trouble
I'll make range
And it seems so strange, but it all makes sense
My back against the wall
End-up behind the fence
Situations always get so tense
And I just want us to still be friends
But we just argue, fuss and fight
And we scream and yell and we curse all night
And it seems that we're always so uptight
Think that it's time that I book this flight
To calm my mind
But I feel so weak
So much to say but I just can't speak
Gotta be dumb, but I can; t even do it
Came as a surprise, but we always knew it
So I'm taking this trip, no plane no car
Might be close and it might be far
But lady soon, when you look up at the moon
I'll be next to it shining like a star

[Chorus:]
I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no I'm a rocket man"
Pop,"The boys find a home in a family born of hate
The girls plant desperate love
In a womb that just won't wait
Forgotten mother pushes a cart with her heart
Through a twisted fate

As walls come down and spirits rise
The business of fear never dies
The artful dodgers with their false alarms
Take from the mouths to feed the arms
Pit god against god for a piece of land
They think they hear his words but they don't understand

Like a river lost on its way to the sea
Where is humanity
I know that nothing will change
'Til it changes in me
'Til it changes in you

There's a plague upon the body
A plague upon the mind
While the bridge is burning are we deaf dumb and blind
>From the fallen forest to the poison bay
The world is turning
Turning out that way

Fe fi fo fum
I smell the blood of an Englishman
Fe fi fo fum
I smell the blood of an Irishman
I smell the blood of an African
I smell the blood of Americans
I smell the blood of a Chinaman
I smell the blood of an Indian
I smell the blood of Rumanians
I smell the blood of a Latin American
I smell the blood of a million sons
I smell the blood of everyone"
Pop,"I'm on the edge (on the edge)
You got me thinking way too hard (way too hard)
You got me playing all my cards
(all my cards)
You know you're tearing me apart
Baby, you're it (babe, you're it)
It's like you're moving slow motion
(slow motion)
You know you're getting in my head
(in my head)
And I can't pretend

Scale 1 to 10, now we're at 11
Stop keeping me guessing (guessing, guessing)
Cause I'm holding in how I'm really feeling
But you've got me stressing (stressing)

Baby, you're way too cool for me
Could someone please turn up the heat?
When you look at me, I freeze
32 degrees, 32 degrees
Now the temp is heating up
But I'm barely keeping up
When you look at me, I freeze
32 degrees, 32 degrees

There will be no doubt
Won't you come figure me out?
Be outside my house
Midnight, throwing rocks
Trying to get me out
Boy, just take me out
Boy, just take me, boy just take me out

Scale 1 to 10, now we're at 11
Stop keeping me guessing (guessing, guessing)

I don't know what you're thinking of me
When you're looking at me, giving me anxiety
And there's just one thing I need
Can you promise me?
Can you promise me, please?

Don't put me in the friend zone
Boy, we're heading for the end zone
Go Netflix on me and download
So you can take me where you go

Don't put me in the friend zone

You can take me where you go
Look at me, I freeze"
Pop,"I'm not gonna live a lie
Just for your entertainment
We started this stupid game
But all the rules have changed again

If I was stranger, would I be safer?
Who do you want me to be, to love, to hurt, to trust?

I'm not gonna fall apart to get your attention
I know what I want, but it's not an addiction
Ohhh oh oh I've only got the truth
Ohhh oh oh Is that enough for you?
I see through your empty affection
I know who I am I can face my reflection
Ohhh oh oh I've only got the truth
Ohhh oh oh, ohh oh

Under the microscope
I see all the imperfections
You wanted me so close
To all the dirt and grime, that's right

If I were a danger, would that amaze you?
Is that who you want me to be, to love, to hurt, to trust?

I'm not gonna fall apart to get your attention
I know what I want, but it's not an addiction
Ohhh oh oh I've only got the truth
Ohhh oh oh Is that enough for you?
I see through your empty affection
I know who I am I can face my reflection
Ohhh oh oh I've only got the truth
Ohhh oh oh, ohh oh

We started this stupid game
And maybe I'll take some blame
But, I can take it all

I'm not gonna fall apart to get your attention
I know what I want (I know what I want)
Ohh oh oh I've only got the truth
Ohh oh oh Is that enough for you?
I see through your empty affection
I know who I am I can face my reflection
Ohhh oh oh I've only got the truth
Ohhh oh oh, ohh oh

Pop,"Must you do this
Treat me ruthless
Make excuses when the truth is that the thought still comes
Now and then when you're in private
You'll consider then the silence tends to sound like drums
You're pretending you don't care
So, I'm doing the same
I like you more when you're taken
Oh Lord, you're good at this game

Don't do me dirty
Show me some mercy
Darlin', please lay down your weaponry
How did I end up somewhere between a lover and a memory?
Cause I don't believe in a halfway heart
And you gave me all of my favorite scars
How did I end up somewhere between a lover and memory?

I been drinking I been smoking
I been waiting I been hoping that there's still some chance
You and me can find a reason to believe in all them weekends that we used to have
You're pretending you don't care
So, I'm doing the same
I like you more when you're taken
Oh Lord, you're good at this game

Don't do me dirty
Show me some mercy
Darlin', please lay down your weaponry (please lay down your weaponry)
How did I end up somewhere between a lover and a memory?
Cause I don't believe in a halfway heart (halfway heart)
And you gave me all of my favorite scars
How did I (how did I) end up somewhere between a (oh) lover and memory?

Don't do me dirty
Show me some mercy
Darlin', please lay down your weaponry
How did I end up somewhere between a lover and a memory?
Cause I don't believe in a halfway heart (I don't believe) (A halfway heart)

Pop,"I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside
I've got to go way
Whoa, but it's cold outside
This evening has been
In hopin' that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

My mother will start to warn me
Beautiful, whats your hurry
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireside roar
Well really, I should just scurry
Beautiful, please dont hurry
But maybe just to have a drink more
Put a record on while I pour

The neighbors might say
Oh baby it's bad out there
Say whats in this drink
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hand, your hair looks swell

I ought to say no, no, no, no sir
Mind if I move in closer
At least I can say that I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride
I really cant stay
Oh baby don't hold out, oh cos it's...
Baby it's
Cold outside"
Pop,"I guess I'm a bad girl
I've learned to make you cry
I'm hanging my guilty conscience
Drying on the line

Love's hangover is driftin' away
I'm good and ready for love
Cos I know it's a saturday

Heaven should help me
You are my weekend lover
Just my play thing, when it's raining
I'm just like the weather
Never the same
I can't help it, I was made that way

I guess you're a bad boy
You fooled around for years
I'm making my mind up baby
A change is good my dear

Love's hangover is driftin' away
I'm good and ready for love
Cos I know it's a saturday

Heaven should help me
You are my weekend lover
Just my play thing, when it's raining
I'm just like the weather
Never the same
I can't help it, I was made that way

Heaven should help you
You better run for cover
I'm sunshine and thunder, it's a wonder
And when I say goodbye
I want you to stay
I can't help it, I was made that way

Heaven should help me
You are my weekend lover
Just my play thing, when it's raining
I'm just like the weather
Never the same
I can't help it, I was made that way

Heaven should help you
You better run for cover
I'm sunshine and thunder, it's a wonder
And when I say goodbye
I want you to stay
I can't help it, I was made that way

I was made that way
And I'm here to stay baby
I was made that way
And I'm here to stay baby
"
Pop,"I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

I know I can treat you better
Than he can
And any girl like you
deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say
You'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving
That you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need
And this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

'Cause I know I can treat you better
Than he can
And any girl like you
deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down


'Cause I know I can treat you better
Than he can
And any girl like you
deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can"
Pop,"The obliteration of your isolation
the complete explosion
of you fondest notion
This disintegration
is your elevation
It's a grand illusion, it's a grand illusion

You're crying,you're trying so hard now
You'll be laughing
a hundred thousand years
There is only one day
and tonight is the night
It's a grand illusion

The devastation of your separation,
the disillusion of
your constitution,
It's exhilaration,it's your liberation
It's a grand illusion,it's a grand illusion

You're crying,you're trying so hard now
You'll be laughing a hundred
thousnad years
There is only one day
and tonight is the night
It's a grand illusion
"
Pop,"You used to bury me, way underground
I thought it had to be this way
But I've been watching you
And I get smarter every day
Take the voices from your mouth
I've got the key to this door
I've learned to work the new machines
I'm not afraid anymore
What you gonna do
What you gonna do about me
You've been stealing all the air
You've been using all the sound
I made a deal with the ocean
I made a deal with the ground
What you gonna do
What you gonna do about me
I am riding on the bus
I am working at my job
I am calling out your name
I am standing at your door
I am counting up the money
I am carrying my child
I am coming down your driveway
I am giving you a chance

"
Pop,"That there, let me break it off
All the pressure that you got, let me take it off
I swear, we're gonna make it hot
Put your hands in the air, don't stop
I'll knock you down like you're Keri
Forget your name like Rihanna
You can run the world, Queen B
Be unthinkable, Alicia
We can go so far if she let go
And I ain't gonna leave without her

This is for the girl that can get down low
The whole club wanna see you go
Ey, shake, shake like you're famous, girl
Head back, lay it down like a Vegas girl
Bass coming down so hard
That little dress breaking every heart
Ey, shake, shake like you're famous, girl
Head back, lay it down like a Vegas girl

Like a Vegas girl

Roll the dice, I've got your number
Hit the jackpot underneath the cover
Intoxicated, you're like a drug, girl
Grab a glass, girl rain tequila
I'll knock you down like you're Keri
Forget your name like Rihanna
You can run the world, Queen B
Be unthinkable, Alicia
We can go so far if she let go
And I ain't gonna leave without her

This is for the girl that can get down low
The whole club wanna see you go
Ey, shake, shake like you're famous, girl
Head back, lay it down like a Vegas girl
Bass coming down so hard
That little dress breaking every heart
Ey, shake, shake like you're famous, girl
Head back, lay it down like a Vegas girl

Like a Vegas girl

It feels so right every night
Like you're in Vegas, girl
(Like a Vegas girl) in Vegas, girl
(Like a Vegas girl) in Vegas, girl
(Like a Vegas girl) in Vegas, girl
(Like a Vegas girl) in Vegas, girl

This is for the girl that can get down low
The whole club wanna see you go
Ey, shake, shake like you're famous, girl
Head back, lay it down like a Vegas girl
Bass coming down so hard
That little dress breaking every heart
Ey, shake, shake like you're famous, girl
Head back, lay it down like a Vegas girl"
Pop,"[Chorus]
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable
So if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
[Intermission]

[Verse 2]
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only care about your
I don't relate to you
No, I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this -y
You make me hate this city

[Verse 3]
And I don't talk - about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that -s embarrassing, and you were my everything
All that you did was make me - sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends
So I shut them all out for you 'cause I was a kid

[Outro]
And you ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just - leave me alone"
Pop,"Away in a manger,
No crib for His bed
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down His sweet head

The stars in the sky
Looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep in the hay

The cattle are lowing
The poor Baby awakes
A little Lord Jesus
No crying He makes

I love Thee, Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my side,
'Til morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus,
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever
And love me I pray

Bless all the dear children
In Thy tender care
And take us to heaven
To live with Thee there

take us to heaven..."
Pop,"My heart is telling me
That you were gonna change but I know
My heart is lying right to my face, yeah
My heart is making up excuses for your ways
But I wish that my heart knew
When I should walk away

It lets me down, knocks me as I get back up
Off the ground, you're telling me that this is love
But I found, it wasn't really on my side
Now I think it's time

I tell my heart to just butt out
Keep its opinion to itself
I should just listen to my head
'Cause it's the one who knows what's best
It tells me not to love you
But my heart says just forgive you
Oh but it's not thinking clearly
I wish that I could leave my heart out of this
Leave my heart out of this

I'm done feeling like a stranger to myself
So I know
I've got to put all my feelings
On a shelf, yeah

It lets me down, knocks me as I get back up
Off the ground, you're telling me that this is love
But I found, it wasn't really on my side
Now I think it's time

I tell my heart to just butt out
Keep its opinion to itself
I should just listen to my head
Cause it's the one who knows what's best
It tells me not to love you
But my heart says just forgive you
Oh but it's not thinking clearly
I wish that I could leave my heart out of this
Leave my heart out of this

Sometimes I wish you'd just shut up
And let me think, I've had enough
I need to just make up my mind, make up my mind
So that's why

I tell my heart to just butt out
Keep its opinion to itself
I should just listen to my head
Cause it's the one who knows what's best
It tells me not to love you
But my heart says just forgive you
Oh but it's not thinking clearly
I wish that I could leave my heart out of this
Leave my heart out of this

Le-le-le-leave my heart
Le-le-le-leave my head
No oh oh oh"
Pop,"It's a good thing, tears never show in the pouring rain
As if a good thing ever could make up for all the pain
There'll be no last chance to promise to never mess it up again
Just a sweet pain of watching your back as you walk
As I'm watching you walk away
And now you're gone it's like an echo in my head
And I remember every word you said

It's a cold thing you never know all the ways I tried
It's a hard thing faking a smile when I feel like I'm falling apart inside
And now you're gone it's like an echo in my head
And I remember every word you said

And you never were, and you never will be mine
No, you never were, and you never will be mine

For the first time, there's no mercy in your eyes
And the cold wind is hitting my face and you're gone
And you're walking away
And I'm helpless sometimes
Wishing's just no good
Cause you don't see me like I wish you would

Cause you never were, and you never will be mine
No, you never were, and you never will be mine

There's a moment to seize everytime that we meet
But you have always keep passing me by

But you never were, and you never will be mine

(I saw you at the station, you had your arm around
Whats her name? She had on that scarf I gave you
you got down to tie her laces)

Cause you never were, and you never will be mine
(You looked happy and that's great)
No, you never were, and you never will be mine
(I just miss you, that's all)

Cause you never were, and you never will be mine
No, you never were, and you never will be mine

There's a moment to seize everytime that we meet
But you have always keep passing me by

No, you never were, and you never will be mine
Cause you never were, and you never will be mine
No, you never were, and you never will be mine

There's a moment to seize everytime that we meet
But you have always keep passing me by
No, you never were, and you never will be mine"
Pop,"I forgot the feeling
The feeling of being alone
But not lonely
I guess when you touch me
My fears and my secrets
Belong to you only
Close the door behind you
Just let me love you, slow you, hold you
My mind stays on you
So does my body let me show you

But I wanna go through
And I wanna need you
Could you be my muse
Lately all I think about is you
I'm never sick about it

This love's incredible-credible
Have a little mercy on me
Baby, you got me
Wanting more, wanting more
Of your love
Incredible-credible
Have a little mercy on me
Baby, you got me
Wanting more, wanting more
Of your love

I know you've been hurt
By the way that you look away
From me too early
You don't like to talk about it
But it was fine, I get it
So don't worry

But I wanna go through
And I wanna need you
Could you be my muse
Lately all I think about is you
I'm never sick about it

This love's incredible-credible
Have a little mercy on me
Baby, you got me
Wanting more, wanting more
Of your love
Incredible-credible
Have a little mercy on me
Baby, you got me
Wanting more, wanting more
Of your love

Wanting more, wanting more
Of your love
Wanting more, wanting more
Of your love
This love
Wanting more, wanting more"
Pop,"Hey!One man, one goal,ha! one mission,
One heart, one soul, just one solution
One flash of light, yeah one god, one vision

One flesh, one bone,
One true religion
One voice, one hope,
One real decision
Wowowowowowo gimmie one vision,

No wrong, no right
I'm gonna tell you
There's no black and no white
No blood, no stain
All we need is one world wide vision

No hate, no fight
Just excitation
All through the night
It's a celebration wowowowowowo yeah,
Wo yeah! Wo yeah!

I had a dream,
When I was young
A dream of sweet illusion
A glimpse of hope and unity
And visions of one sweet union
But a cold wind blows
And a dark rain falls
And in my heart it shows
Look what they've done to my dream, yeeeaaah!

So give me your hands
Give me your hearts
I'm ready
There's only one direction
One world, one nation
Yeah! one vision

One flesh, one bone,

Pop,"It is really very simple
Just a single pulse, repeated at a regular interval

Mmm, hmm
Don't include me out, no
Don't include me out

One time for the records and the hits
Two for your money-maker, shake, boom
Three times for the lucky and the dead

One time for the sorry and safe
Two for the beggar and his company
Three times for the sinner and the saint

Yeah, bow down all you wicked and the vain
Bow to the miracle, the em, na, na
Three times and the devil will be gone

One time for the fire, bring it on
Two for the boogie, gotta bang the beat
Three times for the ladies, show me some love

Talking 'bout everyone, every day, all day

And if your world should fall apart
There's plenty room inside my heart
Just don't include me out
Don't include me out

And if your world should fall apart
I still got room inside my heart
Just don't include me out
Don't include me out, d-d-don't include me out

All hail to the mamas who hold it down
Hail to the pillar of the family
This one's for the granny, take a bow

One time for the crazy and the bent
Come on, all you trannies click your heels for me
All praise the fugeses and the gems

Talking 'bout everyone, every day, all day, oh yeah

And if your world should fall apart
There's plenty room inside my heart
Just don't include me out
Just don't include me out

And if your world should fall apart
I still got room inside my heart
Just don't include me out
Don't include me out, d-d-don't include me out

Can I get a beat, beat for all of my watchamacallits
Doing whatever and with whoever they like?
Can I get a beat, beat for all of my watchamacallits
Doing whatever and with whoever they like?

Can I get a bam, bam for all of my watchamacallits
Doing whatever and with whoever they like?
Can I get a bam, bam for all of my watchamacallits
Doing whatever and with whoever they like?

I'm talking about everyone, every day, all day, hey

Pop,"Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!
Christ, the Saviour is born
Christ, the Saviour is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth"

Spend the night on me
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free
(Free free free free)

When your still in my face
You're messing with my brain
If you're trying to resist me
Then you better think again
If you move to my music
The music's got to give
If I'm too complicated
That's the way I want to live

If you hate me
I will show you
How to brain me
Into something new
If you want me
Run away now
If you stop me
Then I'll hit the ground

Round, round baby round, round

Getting down to the fun

Just tonight he'll be mine
And he's gone

People moving, bodies grooving
Never ending
Place is moving

Ooh
Does it hurt, when you see
How I've done
Without you
Thought that I could belong
Never thought that you could be so cruel
All you need is some friends
Won't be by yourself

Pop,"Watching every motion
In my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean
Finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say
My love

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching I keep waiting
Still anticipating love
Never hesitating
To become the fated ones
Turning and returning
To some secret place to inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn to me and say
My love

Take my breath away

Through the hourglass I saw you
In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today
I am unafraid

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching every motion
In this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion
Somewhere there's a love in flames
Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn my way and say

Take my breath away
My Love
Take my breath away
My Love
Take my breath away
Take my breath away"
Pop,"You can dance with anybody if you wanna dance
I know you didn't come just to sit and watch me
With a drink in my hand

You can laugh with anybody who can make you laugh
You're the baddest, I'm barely looking at you
Girl do you understand?

And all night long
I'm tryna get you out of here
And baby it's alright
As long as you don't forget

(chorus)
Just don't forget
Who's taking you home
Who's holding you close
When everyone's gone
Just don't forget
Who's tucking you in
When records don't spin
Again and again
Just don't forget
And all night long
I'm tryna get you out of here
And baby it's alright
As long as you don't forget
Just don't forget

Just don't forget

Looking good, now I see you from the other side
If this is what they see when I'm with you
Then I'm a lucky guy yea

It's so good, go ahead and spread your wings tonight
It's only right
Well you look so fly

And all night long
I'm tryna get you out of here
And baby it's alright

Going, do you?
It's your tonight
I'll be waiting, take your time

And you know whenever you're ready we'll go
As long as I get you alone
Where there's no distraction there's only attraction girl

Pop,"Ooh, oh-oh, ooh, oh-oh
Ooh, oh-oh, na, na
Ooh, oh-oh, ooh, oh-oh
Ooh, oh-oh, oh (x2)

Normally it wouldn't be me
Acting all spiteful
The way that I am, oh, oh
But you did me so damn dirty
That I can't force myself to give a damn, oh
Lied to me about this one, that one
Like it was a game
That you couldn't stop playing, playing
So I don't feel not a damn bit guilty that I'm
Showing interest in one of your friends
'Cause it was what is was
Now it is what it is, boy

We're not together
I couldn't be more happy (ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh, na, na)
Since there's not more you
I'm finally going after me (ooh, oh-oh, oh)
I'm a do what I want to do
No more you (ooh, oh-oh, oh)
Said I'm a do what I wanna do
No more you

Everything you didn't like me wearing
Now comes out of that box in the closet, oh, oh
And the necklace that you gave me
Would've gave it back
But I think I lost it, oh, sorry
I remember how you didn't like how
Some of your boys used to stare at me, oh, oh
What if you saw me out
One night with one of them
Tell me would it make you angry (Really?)
Well it was what is was
Now it is what it is, boy

We're not together
I couldn't be more happy (ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh, na, na)
Since there's not more you
I'm finally going after me (ooh, oh-oh, oh)
I'm a do what I want to do
No more you (ooh, oh-oh, oh)
Said I'm a do what I wanna do
No more you

Wasted so much time
Trying to keep you happy, oh
I was thinking 'bout you
You were thinking 'bout you
Who was thinking 'bout me
Nobody
So now it's time that I do me

Oh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, hey

We're not together
I couldn't be more happy (ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh,, na, na)
Since there's no more you
I'm finally going after me (ooh, oh-oh, oh)

Pop,"The streetlights were gold
You were standing by my car
I jumped and you caught me
I'm hanging on your every word
And I can barely breathe
And you're so tall when I'm next to you
I look up at you
And try to hide my smile
You walk me to my door
I've pictured this million times before

I'm sitting on these stars
Staring at the wall
But light's shinning
But I can't see at all
Just tryna connect things in my mind

Wish I could have this my way
But I know you can't stay

You stand there in my driveway
You're a red light on a highway
And I'm drowning
In the sound of your name
Between late nights and mistakes
I can't stand in this earthquake
I Look up at the sky
The lights starting to face
Here comes sunsets and heartbreak
I'm going down
I'm going down
I'm going down
Our story is sunsets and heartbreak

Sitting in my car today
It's like nothing even happened yesterday
But you were here right next to me
I swear I could replay it all day long
When I sang that song
Looked over at you
Saw your smile
And I was gone

This little town is magic
It's making me feel things
I never thought I would
My name's in your phone every night
You tell me about your sister and your family
Gave myself away now you know
I'm in love with your laugh
Cause I can't even hold it back

Wish we could just stay here
But I know it's not real

You stand there in my driveway
You're a red light on a highway
And I'm drowning
In the sound of your name
Between late nights and mistakes
I can't stand in this earthquake
I Look up at the sky
The lights starting to face
Here comes sunsets and heartbreak
I'm going down
I'm going down
I'm going down
Our story is sunsets and heartbreak

I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna say goodbye
Maybe if I close my eyes
Maybe if I hold real tight
I won't have to say goodbye

You stand there in my driveway
You're a red light on a highway

Between late nights and mistakes
I can't stand in this earthquake
I Look up at the sky
The lights starting to face
Here comes sunsets and heartbreak"
Pop,"Lying in your arms, so close together,
Didn't know just what I had.
Now I toss and turn, cause I'm without you,
How I'm missing you so bad.
Where was my head?
Where was my heart?
Now I cry alone in the dark.

CHORUS:
I lie awake I drive myself crazy,
Drive myself crazy, thinking of you.
Made a mistake when I let you go baby.
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do. (Wanting you the way that I do)

I was such a fool, I couldn't see it.
Just how good you were to me
You confessed your love, and dying devotion.
I confessed my need to be free.
And now I'm left with all this pain,
I've only got my self to blame.

Chorus

Why didn't I know how much I loved you baby?
Why didn't I show it? If only I showed it baby
Oh I had a chance!
Oh I had a chance!

La La La La La La La La La La La La

I Drive myself Crazy Ohhhhhhhh
Oh so crazy La La La La
Oh Oh Oh Oh...

I lie awake I drive myself crazy,
Drive myself crazy, thinkin' of you
Made a mistake when I let you go baby
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
I drive myself (CRAZY,CRAZY,CRAZY,YEAH)
Made a mistake when I let you go baby I drive myself crazy,
Wanting you the way that I do,
Wanting you the way that I do.
Drive myself Crazy wanting you the way that I do

Pop,"Wake up in the morning, you were gone, gone, gone

Can't believe you made me wanna smile, smile, smile
Baby cause I still believe that you'll mine, mine, mine

Pa pa papa pa prrra pa papa
Gonna talk about us all over the town, town, town

Never blame you even thought you let me down

Boys will be boys
They like to play around
You shot me with your love gun
I'm falling to the ground

Boys will be boys
They like to play around
So tell me how to love one
That's running like a hound

Boys will be boys
Boys will be boys

Boys are always playing silly games, games, games
If I fall, then I'm the only one to blame, blame, blame
Trouble wants to find me all the time, time, time
That's why you're never gonna see me cry, cry, cry

Pa pa papa pa prrra pa papa
Gonna talk about us all over the town, town, town

Came to this party looking for fun
I saw this hotte looking like a number one
He was so suave, (he was so suave)
Said baby, come? (said baby, come?)
We did that until we saw the morning sun

Boys will be boys
They like to play around
You shot me with your love gun
I'm falling to the ground

Boys will be boys
They like to play around
So tell me how to love one

Pop,"I said, sorry I didn't finish
Sorry you didn't fit

Pop,"Spirits move me, everytime I'm near you
Whirlig like a ciclone in my mind
Your my life line, angel of my lifetime
Answer to all answer I can find

Baby I want you come, come, come into my arms
Let me feel the wonder of all of you
Could it be magic now, now, now and hold on fast
Could it be magic at last

Baby take me high upon a hillside
High up where the stallion meets the sun
I could love you build my world around you
Never leave you 'till my life is done

To what we have
Good times that made us laugh
Holding them back

I thought we'd get to see tomorrow
I hope this was all the pain

It's so hard
To say goodbye
To yesterday

And I'll take with me the memories
To make my sunshine after the rain

Well its so hard

I was hers
She was mine
We were together all the time
Oh, my Jane
Oh, my Jane

Maybe it's the right thing, and maybe it's wrong
You know I lay awake and wonder all night long
Maybe it's over and maybe we're free
You know this lonely feelin' is drownin' me

Will I rise up again?
Will I ever know a friend, like my Jane?
Oh, my Jane

Pop,"I want every tear back that I cried
I want every lie back that I lied
I want every day I gave to you
I want back a heart that's clean and new

Is this your hand?
Is this your skin?
Where do you end and I begin?
Is this your breath inside my lungs?
I do not know what I've become
I want every tear back
That a cried

Any love is good love so they say
And you'd be a fool to walk away
I recall a friend I used to know
Who are you and where did that man go?
Do I repeat the words you said?
Is this your voice inside my head?
Where is the mind that was so strong?
I do not know where I belong
I want every tear back

That I cried
I'm about to break
I'm about to break this chain
Will I ever love
Will I ever love again?
Can it fall away can it fall away like rain?
I'm about to break
I'm about to break this chain

Is this your hand?
Is this your skin?
Where do you end and I begin?
Is this your breath that fills my lungs?
I do not know what I've become
I want every tear back
That I cried
I'm about to break

I'm about to break this chain
Will I ever love
Will I ever love again?
Can it fall away can it fall away like rain?
I'm about to break
I'm about to break this chain"

Ahh what's going on

Ja Rule:
What's going on in a world filled with pain
Where's the love for which we pray
What's going on
When our children can't play
Homeless can't eat
There's got to be a better way
What's going on
When we politically blind
Can't see the signs of endangered times
What's going on

Nelly:
What's going on 'cross seas
Every minute a child dies by this disease
In record numbers indeed
Got momma's crying out please

My child ain't done nothing wrong
Still I want to holler
Ask them why they don't bother
Oh no, oh no
Make me turn to my father
And ask him why they all got a trapped soul, trapped soul

Nas:
I can feel what was bothering Marvin
Why his words forever remain
Dealing with these modern day problems
'Cause of ignorance surrounding me and my constituents
Too many infected
Too many lives diminishing
Nobody say Protestants, Jews, Blacks, and Whites, Latinos andAsians
Pray together
Less fight
We better unite
As genocide chemical war
And the rich and the poor
Know that God delivers a cure

Eve:
It's a shame our reality is devastating
People praying for a cure
Dying while they're waiting
Ask the Lord for the comfort and strength to face it
All the kids with dreams
Won't get the chance to chase it
Makes me sad
Think about the lives they would've had
Think about the orphan babies got no moms and dads
How can we sit back and not try to make it right
We gotta come together
We gotta fight for life

Fred Durst:
Somebody tell me what's going on
(what's going on)
We got human beings using humans for a bomb
But everyone wanna live
Don't nobody really want to die
You feeling me right
I can't be watching people die
(die)
And watching people cry
Let me break it down for a minute
If there's enough room here for you and me
There's plenty of room for some humanity

Somebody tell me what's going on

Somebody tell me what's going on

Somebody tell me what's going on

Christmas is all around
Somethin about this special time of year
A blanket of snow falls down from the sky
Voices of angels
Open our hearts so we can open our arms

(Chorus:)
And we'll all join hands
To celebrate the goodness
That shines inside of everyone
It must have been a part of some great design
Guess it's Christmas time

Seein the face of the little boys and girls
Singing their First Noel
A sweet refrain heard all around the world
A song of forgiveness, comforting peace
A time to remember what life really means
(Life really means)
The important things (Important things)

Guess it's Christmas time
Open our hearts so we can open our arms

Must have been a part of some great design
Guess it's Christmas time

Pop,"In her eyes, another moment dies
Tears collide, solo she rides
Heart torn down the middle
Time slows her pace
Smiles just a little
Takes her away

A thousand stories never told
A million dreams she won't let go
The singing, singing stops her thinking
Her life looks prettier inside
So many reasons she's alone
Countless friends she'll never know
She's singing, singing, singing, singing
Lost in her beautiful mind
Lost in her beautiful mind

Here we stand, no memories to plan
Through our hands
Hopes like drifting sand
You'll never forget her
Neither can he
Who ended up better?
Who do you believe?

A thousand stories never told
A million dreams she won't let go
The singing, singing stops her thinking
Her life looks prettier inside
So many reasons she's alone
Countless friends she'll never know
She's singing, singing, singing, singing
Lost in her beautiful mind
Lost in her beautiful mind

Nobody's gonna save her now
'Cos everybody wants to save themselves
Nobody's gonna save her now

A thousand stories never told
A million dreams she won't let go
The singing, singing stops her thinking
Her life looks prettier inside
So many reasons she is alone
Countless friends she'll never know
She's singing, singing, singing, singing
Lost in her beautiful mind

Let's sing together
Lost in her beautiful mind

And the sorrow that you know will melt away

And then a hero comes along,
With the strength to carry on,
And you'll finally see the truth,
That a hero lives in you

Oooh
Lord knows, dreams are hard to follow
In time, you'll find the way

And then a hero comes along,
With the strength to carry on,
And you cast your fears aside baby,
And you know you that you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone,
Look inside you and be strong,
And you'll finally see the truth,
That a hero lives in you"
Pop,"Eye-poppin', gate-crashin'
light-flashin', fence-hoppin' love
Mind-spinnin', back-breakin'
soul-takin', heart-stoppin' love

So take a minute
Take your heart to the limit
Baby own it and make it your fight

We're gonna be out of our heads, tonight
We're gonna be out of our heads
We're gonna be out of our heads, tonight
We're gonna be out of our heads
The past, the present
and the future is gonna be fine
We're gonna be out of our heads, tonight
We're gonna be out of our heads
Oh all the law-breakers
all the naughty love-makers
This is your time

Arm-thrashin', chest-thumpin'
out-calmin', deep-breathin' love
Whoa-oh
Fist-punchin', headbangin'
up-soundin', jaw-crunchin' love

So take a mouthful
Who wants to be subliminal
Oh if we make it to light

We're gonna be out of our heads, tonight
We're gonna be out of our heads
We're gonna be out of our heads, tonight
We're gonna be out of our heads
The past, the present
and the future is gonna be fine
We're gonna be out of our heads, tonight
We're gonna be out of our heads
Oh all the law-breakers
all the naughty love-makers
This is your time

Only the seven
Turn it up to eleven
Baby, no, don't filter the light
Yeah, we all have a mission
Take the time to wet the levee
From the left, right, and fallin' behind

We're gonna be out of our heads, tonight
We're gonna be out of our heads
We're gonna be out of our heads, tonight
We're gonna be out of our heads
The past, the present
and the future's gonna be alright
We're gonna be out of our heads, tonight
We're gonna be out of our heads
Oh all the law-breakers
all the naughty love-makers
This is your time (this is your time)

This is your time"
Pop,"Comin' out of the window
Watchin' down from the wall
Billie listens to your heartbeat
Floatin' down the hall
You think my eyes are covered over
You think my heart has crawled away
Billie listens to your heartbeat
When I don't know what to say
I meant to be your drivin' wheel
I meant to be your swing
If I had a tongue like that
I would keep you safe
I would keep you safe from everything
I made a deal with the ocean
I made a deal with the ground
Billie listins to your heartbeat
When I'm not around
When I'm not around

"
Pop,"I was in love the moment that
I saw you
I followed you thru the crowd and I almost lost you
I was dying to tell you but scared of your reaction
But I can't hold back because I'm rushed
with this thing called passion

You've got me knocked out turn me inside out
It's you that makes my heart beat
You've got me knocked out
Baby there's no doubt
You swept me off my feet

I walked your way hoping that
Maybe you noticed
I don't want to move so fast
I don't want to blow it
Never did I think love could be so amazing
But the things that you're making me do
It's driving me crazy

Repeat chorus twice

I want us to be closer, boy I wanna be
Startin' somethin with you baby
My heart is steady knockin boy you've got my body rockin,
caught blow-by-blow, love T.K.O.

Repeat chorus twice and fade
"
Pop,"They tried to catch a falling star
Thinking that she had gone too far
She did but kept it hidden well
Until she cracked and then she fell
If all the history is true
She's gonna end up just like you
You made it to the other side
But tell me who will be my guide
They build you up so they can tear you down
Trust the ocean you'll never drown
Who is next?
Who's gonna steal your crown?
You'll see

I have learnt my lesson well
The truth is out there I can tell
Don't look back and don't give in to their lies and goodbyes
Northern star

Fulfil the longing in your heart
Then we will never be apart
And if they dare to question you
Just tell them that our love is true
They buy your dreams so they can sell your soul
Is it any wonder we've lost control?
Feelings come. Feelings go.

I have learnt my lesson well.
The truth is out there I can tell
Don't look back and don't succumb to their lies and goodbyes
Live your life without regret.
Don't be the someone who they forget
When you're lost reach out for me
And you'll see she's not far.
Northern star.
Northern star.

Pop,"Talking in my sleep
She ain't gonna hear it
So my secrets have to keep
A little while longer
In my heart where they've been
For so long I can't remember

Days turn into weeks
Still she's not with me
Still my secrets have to keep
A little while longer
In my heart where they've been
For so long I can't remember


And I know that I'm just gonna be
Another page in love's history
Another page in your diary
In that old book of love


Love can cut you deep
It's there to remind you
And the memories make you weak
They whisper to you
From your heart where they've been
For so long you can't remember


Wake up
Reach for her
She's not there
All I do is dream
Dream that she will come home soon
To me

"
Pop,"I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town
No post code envy

But every song's like gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like cristal, maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

Ooh ooh ohh
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen

Ooh oh oh
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy"
Pop,"Where are the bones on that one
What if the cure is worse than the disease
Serve me up some pretty, pretty people
Serve me up somebody I can believe

Don't feel sorry for me
I hate that look on your face
You say, just let go
You say, come back home
I say, I'm just fallin' from grace

I'm naked in a hotel room
My station comin' in, comin' in loud and clear
I'm makin' out with my one true love
I'm makin' this hotel room disappear

Stop feelin' sorry for me
I hate that look on your face
You say, just let go
You say, come back home
I say, I'm just fallin' from grace
I say that like fallin' from grace

You never know it to look at me
A Dracula moon
See love come down any way you want to
Doesn't ask for your permission
Open up your arms and we will break you in too(two?)

Stop feelin' sorry for me
I hate that look on your face
You say, just let go
You say, come back home
I say, I'm just fallin' from grace
I say, I'm just fallin' from grace...
Just fallin'
Just fallin'...

I'm smooth and heavy all over the world
I'm smooth and heavy all over the world

"
Pop,"Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Always been told that I've got too much pride
Too independant to have you by my side
But my heart said all of you will see
Just won't live for someone until he'll live for me
Never thought I would find love so sweet
Never thought I would meet someone like you
Well now I've found you and I'll tell you no lie
This love I've got for you
Could take me 'round the world

Now show me love
Show me love, show me life
Baby show me what it's all about
You're the one that I ever needed
Show me love and what it's all about, alright
Don't waste this love I wanna give it to you
Tell me what you got, show me what you can do
Show me love, show me everything

I know you've got potential
So baby let me in and show me love
Show me love, show me life (alright)
Baby show me what it's all about
You're the only one that I ever needed (show me love)

Show me love and what it's all about, alright
Show me love, show me life
Baby show me what it's all about
You're the one that I ever needed
Show me love and what it's all about, alright
Show me love baby
Show me everything you've got and show me life
Show me love baby
Show me everything and what it's all about

You're the one, the only one I ever needed
Show me love and what it's all about, alright
I'll love you
I'll miss you
I'll make sure
Everything will be alright
I'll give you my heart if you just give me love
Every day and every night
Show me love, show me life (alright)
Baby show me what it's all about
You're the one that I ever needed

Show me love and what it's all about, alright
Show me love, show me life (alright)
Baby show me what it's all about
You're the one that I ever needed
Show me love and what it's all about, alright
"
Pop,"It's always something
It's always something there to spoil your day
It's always something made out of nothing
But it gets its way

My AOL went down again
They're starving in Zaire
Close your eyes and count to ten
The sky is falling dear

It's always something
Something you're waiting that will make you whole
Some piece of nothing you need so badly
That youl'd sell your soul

How many inches is your screen
Are the images too clear
Just channel surf the news away
The sky is falling
Your god is calling

I may not know it
I may not see
It's always something messin' with me
I may not like it but it will be
And if I fight it'll never be free

There's always something we could be learning
From those windmill fores
It's always someone you least expected
Who really knows

That there's no better time or place
To read between the lines on your face
Stop choking on that grain of salt
The sky's not falling
We've just been staling

I may not know it
I may not see
It's always something messin' with me
I may not like it but it will be
And if I fight it'll never be free"
Pop,"We used to rule the world together
Thought that we would rule forever
Somehow, somehow

There was nothing that we couldn't do
Noone understood like you
Not now, not now

And we're running at the speed or crawling
Trying to restart but we're stalling
We should give up, we should give up, we should give up

But it's too soon to be too late
Gotta keep on fighting, gotta keep trying

Tell myself
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop no
Don't stop, don't stop

I know that we're breaking but we're not broke
Maybe there's no point, no way, no hope
It would be too easy to throw this away
But it's too soon, too soon, to be too late

We were wasted, now we're sober
Try to think that we're hungover
All day, always

If we could put the pieces back
Would we have, what we had again?
I wanna feel it again

Cos we were flyin' without a fear of falling
Never second guessed, we were all in
We should give up, we should give up, we should give up

But it's too soon to be too late
Gonna keep on fighting, gonna keep trying

Tell myself
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop no
Don't stop, don't stop

I know that we're breaking but we're not broke
Maybe there's no point, no way, no hope
It would be easy to throw this away
But it's too soon, too soon, to be too late

Too soon to be over
Too soon to get off
Too soon to surrender
I don't care how long we're running at the speed or crawling
Trying to restart but we're stalling
Never give up, never give up, never give up

Cos it's too soon to be too late
Gotta keep on fighting, gotta keep trying

Tell myself
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop no
Don't stop, don't stop

I know that we're breaking but we're not broke
Maybe there's no point, no way, no hope
It would be too easy to throw this away
But it's too soon to be too late"
Pop,"So here I am, got myself together
All in my mind, it took some time, but I got better
Spring's in my walk, look in the mirror
Got no complaints, I'm feeling great, I'm seeing clearer

And they'll try to bring me down, down, down, down
Put some grey in the clouds, cloud, cloud, cloud, cloud
But I'm over it now, now, now, now, now
I'm on a mission, so you better listen

Come and share this feeling with me
Don't hold back you deserve to be free
Celebrate being different and unique
Don't let the haters get you
Just show yourself a little self love, self love
Celebrate being different and unique
Don't let the haters get you
Just show yourself a little self love

Can't change the past, only the future
I know the voice inside your head can try to fool ya
Gon' show the world, that you're brand new yeah
Breaking the mould, looking like gold, and that's the truth babe

And they'll try to bring you down, down, down, down
Put some grey in the clouds, cloud, cloud, cloud, cloud
But you're over it now, now, now, now, now
We're on a mission, they better listen

Come and share this feeling with me
Don't hold back you deserve to be free
Celebrate being different and unique
Don't let the haters get you
Just show yourself a little self love, self love
Celebrate being different and unique
Don't let the haters get you
Just show yourself a little self love

Come and share this feeling with me
Don't hold back you deserve to be free
Celebrate being different and unique
Don't let the haters get you
Just show yourself a little self love, self love

Celebrate being different and unique
Don't let the haters get you
Just show yourself a little self love, self love
Celebrate being different and unique
Don't let the haters get you
Just show yourself a little self love"
Pop,"I'm a writer and a lover
I'm a Midwest music man
And I've been to a lot of places
But I'm gon' end where I began
I took class in Carolina
Got high smoking joints
And now they know my name in Paris

But I'll be buried in Detroit
Next to my father, and my father's father too
I used to live in New York City
But baby that ain't no substitute
Not for my hometown
That place people avoid
I've made love in every city
But I'll be buried in Detroit

I don't claim to be a prophet
I just speak my mind
I try to tell it like it is
And sometimes God makes it rhyme

I like my songs how I like my women
Honest and to the point
You see I got fucked up in Stockholm

But I'll be buried in Detroit
Next to my father, my father's father too
I used to live in New York City
But baby that ain't no substitute
Not for my hometown
That place people avoid
I've made love in every city
But I'll be buried in Detroit

You know I ain't gon' live forever
Baby it won't be long
At the wake they'll say ""He made a lot of mistakes
But he could write hell of a song""

And I made, I made killing
Though I never really was employed
I had a girl from San Diego

But I'll be buried in
I killed a show in Indonesia
But I'll be buried in
I made love in every city
But I'll be buried in Detroit"
Pop,"What if this is nearly over?
Everything coming to an end
As I see fading colours
Finding it harder to pretend
No one can take away the days that we conquered
They hang like shadows in my mind
Everything I thought
Everything I felt
Thank God that's over
Reading the signs
We're out of time
There is always a new story
Another player in the game
Can I rise to a new glory?
Or will these demons keep me chained?
Sometimes fear consumes my every emotion
So I'm drifting with the tide
Everything I am
Everything I did
With total devotion
Reading the signs
We're out of time
The sun will still rise
Maybe shine a little bit brighter
No matter what they say
We can reach a little bit higher
Shake away the chains
We can do this together
I know with you by my side
We'll be alright
The sun is gonna rise...
Alright alright
We'll be alright
Alright alright
We'll be alright
Alright.

Pop,"I've really got to use my imagination
To think of good reasons
To keep on keepin' on

Got to make the best of a bad situation
Ever since that day
I woke up and found
That you were gone

Darkness all around me
Blackin’ out the sun
Old friends call me
But I just don't feel like talkin’ to anyone

Emptiness has found me
And it just won't let me go
I go right on livin'
But why I just don't know

Staring down reality
Don't do me no good
'Cause our misunderstanding
Is too well understood

Such a sad, sad season
When a good love dies.
Not a day goes by
When I don’t realize

I've really got to use my imagination
To think of good reasons
To keep on keepin' on

I got to make the best of a bad situation
Ever since that day
I woke up and found
That you were gone"
Pop,"On a pitch black highway lookin’ for a road
Sleepin’ on a stormy bed, honey, who will be your coat
Came to be my drivin’ wheel, you came to be my man
Now you’re rollin’ like a baby boy in the backseat of a van

Holy waters, holy way
Holy waters, sweetest way

Mississippi and Missouri
Where the sun swims with the moon
Rainbows run through chapel rooms
Pourin’ honey by the spoon
In came to bring you watermelon
Bring you scented wine
Now I’m burning up in hot breath
And the rivers rollin’ out of time

Holy waters, holy way
Holy waters, sweetest way

I listen to a seashell out on a purple shore
I heard a song so wild and sweet it moved me to the core
So while the road is dancin’ you let your love know how
Move it like the ocean and the waves from here tonight

Holy waters, holy way
Holy waters, sweetest way

Holy waters, holy way
Holy waters, sweetest way

Holy waters, holy way
Holy waters, sweetest way

Holy waters, holy way
Holy waters, sweetest way"
Pop,"Once upon a time
Before all this mess began
I never felt alone
All now stolen

Simple and surreal
Was it a world of make-believe
You could take by the hand
And I'd follow

Hear my voice
Did you see me coming
I made the choice
Now I'm running
Turn me round
Let me go
Take me home

Never thought I'd see the day
When my life was not my own
I will throw it all away
Without sorrow

But it wouldn't change a thing
Wouldn't change the way I feel
For today is the price I pay
For tomorrow

Hear my voice
Did you see me coming
I made a choice
Now I'm running
Turn me round
Let me go
Take me home

Somehow suddenly
It slipped away from me
I reach out, hopelessly
You're gone

Hear my voice
Did you see me coming
I made a choice
Now I'm running
Turn me round
Let me go
Take me home

Hear my voice
Did you see me coming
I made a choice, but
Now I'm running
So turn me round
Let me go
Take me home

Pop,"Do you think you can
Talk to me anyway you want?
Do you really think I wouldn't know
And in this game, you'd better off?
So get ready for war,
Cuz I have the best guns.
I'm sure I'll win,
What happen for me it doesn't matter.

[Chorus]
It doesn't matter what you do,
The game is over for you.
(The game is over, you, you had your order)
Do not even try again,
Cuz you made your greatest mistake.
(You had your order, oh, the game is over)
For You
For You, For You, For You

If you think you will be immune
From the consequences
Okay to me,
If we have our differences
But does not mean you can judge me
You're no better than anyone
And should respect me

[Chorus]
It doesn't matter what you do,
The game is over for you.
(The game is over, you, you had your order)
Do not even try again,
Cuz you made your greatest mistake.
(You had your order, oh, the game is over)

No man, no cry

I've had enough of all your lies and all your silly games
I'm running out
Can't you see what you're doing?
I never ever thought that you'd treat me so cruel
But you proved me wrong and now you know I'm just a fool
Don't keep me guessing, always stressing all the time
You want to play this game, true love is hard to find
And if I walk there won't be no more coming back
In fact you'll be missing this, wish you should be kissing this
Baby check my rhyme

No man, no cry
No man, that's alright
No we won't be played
Listen all you ladies cuz the babes are taking over this place
No man, no cry
No man telling me lies
No we won't be played
We're here to tell you fellas that the babes are taking over your place

I'm feeling angry by the way that you treat me lately
Do you see me as some fool, remember what I'm worth boy
No disrespecting me, upsetting me with talk, or this lady's gonna walk
And while I'm thinking baby, tell me what did you do
Just interrupt good times that should have been with my crew
I bring you down when I tell your boys...
I won't be sitting here now waiting for your call
I ain't some little girl, baby you know the score
Don't want to feel like I'm not the only one
Baby you did me wrong, I'm not your bitch, don't trip, I'm moving on

No man, no cry
No man, pass on by
No we won't be played
Listen all you ladies cuz the babes are taking over this place
No man, no cry
No man telling me lies
No we won't be played
We're here to tell you fellas that the babes are taking over your place

I'm moving on
I said I'm moving on
I'm moving on and on, on
On, on, on
Said I'm moving on

No man, no cry
No man, that's alright
No we won't be played
Listen all you ladies cuz the babes are taking over this place
No man, no cry
No man telling me lies
No we won't be played
We're here to tell you fellas that the babes are taking over your place

No man, no cry
No man, that's alright
No we won't be played
Be played no more

No we won't be played

Pop,"When you're down
Don't be afraid to pray out loud
Just close your eyes and let it out
Take all your fears and doubts
He's listening right now
Don't be afraid to pray out loud
Pray out loud

Everybody's got their problems
Everybody's got their struggles
We all need a helping hand sometimes
Sometimes

And I think back to when I was a little girl
My daddy said remember Jess
............. this world (??)

When you're down
Don't be afraid to pray out loud
Just close your eyes and let it out
Take all your fears and doubts
He's listening right now
Don't be afraid to pray out loud

Don't have to face it on your own
We don't have to be alone
Just open up your arms and look up at the sky
And pray out loud

When you're down
Don't be afraid to pray out loud
Just close your eyes and let it out
All your fears and doubts
He's listening right now

Ohh, when you're down
Don't be afraid to pray out loud
Just close your eyes and let it out
All your fears and doubts
He's listening right now

Don't be afraid to pray out loud
Pray out loud
Pray out loud
Don't be afraid to pray out loud"

Hark! The herald angels sing

Hail the heav'n-born Prince of Peace!
Hail the Son of Righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings
Ris'n with healing in His wings
Mild He lays His glory by
Born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth
Hark! The herald angels sing
""Glory to the newborn King! """
Pop,"Amy
Can you feel me
When i think about you
With every breath i take
Every minute
No matter what i do
My world is an empty place

Christina
Like i've been wanderin' the desert for thousand days
Don't know if it's a mirage
But i always see your face, baby

Chorus:
I'm missing you so much - can't help it i'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side don't know how i'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain
Whoooaaaaaaaa

Dani
The stars are burning
I hear your voice in my mind
Can't you hear me callin'
My heart is yearning like the ocean is running dry
Catch me i'm fallin'

Katherine
It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet, won't you save me
There's gonna be a monsoon when you get back to me, oh baby

Chorus:
I'm missing you so much - can't help it i'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side don't know how i'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain
Whoooaaaaaaaa

Lauren
So let this drought come to an end
And make this desert flower again
So let this drought come to an end
And make this desert flower again
I'm so glad you found me, stick around me
Baby baby baby, ooh

Lisa
It's a world of wonder with you in my life
So hurry baby don't waste no more time
I need you here, i can't explain
But a day without you
Is like a year without rain
Ohhohoh

Chorus:
I'm missing you so much - can't help it i'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side don't know how i'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain
Whoooaaaaaaaa"
Pop,"U drive me crazy
Why are you messin' with my mind
U drive me crazy
Why are you tellin' all these lies
U drive me crazy
Stop doing all these things to me
U drive me crazy
'Cause all I want is to be free

I'm feeling weak, I cannot sleep
My head is burning, I feel cold down to my feet
I wanna yell, somebody help
Is there a cure for what I've got
Somebody tell me
I need your lovin' face
I need your sweet embrace
'Cause you are my only medicine

U drive me crazy
Why are you messin' with my mind
U drive me crazy
Why are you tellin' all these lies
U drive me crazy
Stop doing all these things to me
U drive me crazy
'Cause all I want is to be free

You're on my mind I'm so uptight
I feel sensation in my head down to my spine
Going insane, can't stand the pain
Is my condition permanent, somebody tell me
I need your lovin' face
I need your sweet embrace
'Cause you are my only medicine

U drive me crazy
Why are you messin' with my mind
U drive me crazy
Why are you tellin' all these lies

24/7
You're on my mind, I'm going crazy
You are the cure and you know but you don't care
Girl you driving me insane

You can say what you want to
Do what you wanna do
As long as you love me, girl, I won't front you
You're the sweetest thing
Let me be your man
Let me hold your hand
Or let me be your friend
Meanwhile I will set the house
Up on hill
Girl as you know it's all about the dollar-bill
Gonna treat you like a queen
Like a lady
Chica, chico, you drive me crazy

You're always on my mind
Need you all the time
So come and get with me
'Cause darlin' you're the one I need
Someone to hold me tight
'Cause I can't sleep at night
You are my fantasy
Girl you drive me crazy

U drive me crazy
Why are you messin' with my mind
U drive me crazy
Why are you tellin' all these lies
U drive me crazy
Stop doing all these things to me
U drive me crazy

Pop,"(Robb Boldt / Howie Hersh / Iki Levy)

Day or night it's the way of life
Whatever keeps me pumpin'
Whatever makes me feel alright
Well I've been tryin' to find myself
I was in a trance but now I feel like dancin
Put on your platforms, get your move on
Won't flow to nothin' I don't like
My vibe is mental, it's never gentle
You gotta do your own thing move it side to side
Now if you love yourself, throw your hands in the air
And if you think you're sexy
Clap your hands like you just don't care

Chorus:
All you gotta do
(Sexy things)
Is be a little sexy
(Bring sexy thoughts)
All you gotta do
(Sexy thoughts, SEX)
Is be a little sexy

I got an attitude
I got a complex
I'm feeling funky
I bet'cha knew that
When you saw me
(You thought you could take me to another place)
But I ain't hip to that
I ain't with that
Here comes the spotlights
I gotta get mine, so move that body
If you ain't got it
It's all about strength, poise, so make some noise
You don't have to let nobody know
How you're gonna steal the show
Now if you love yourself, throw your hands in the air
And if you think you're sexy
Clap your hands like you just don't care

"
Pop,"I wanna be with you
I wanna get with you
This is how it's gotta be
So real
Whatcha like in the daytime?
It's my time, to find out
How it's gonna be, yeah
Between you and me, oh
Everything seems so cool
Listen to my groove

Why are you creeping?
Sneaking undercover boy
If you're out come around
Cos I'm diggin you
I want you
But I don't know
Can you tell me how far you wanna go?
I'm head over heels, yeah
Baby tell me how you feel, ah
Stop the chasing
Cos we're facing
You and me together as one

Chorus:
This is not a party song
This is not a party tune
This is not a party thing
This is not a party.. with you
If you wanna party with me
Can't afford to get this wrong
If you wanna get this on
Bring your party to me

Just a fussy girl
In a messy world
Keep things playing straight
That's me
So you gotta be always clear with me
It's all about me being happy
Gotta be, all I wanna see, eh
No attitudes on getting things wrong]

Chorus:
This is not a party song
This is not a party tune
This is not a party thing
This is not a party.. with you
If you wanna party with me
Can't afford to get this wrong
If you wanna get this on
Bring your party to me

This is not a party song
This is not a party tune

This is not a party song
This is not a party tune
This is not a party thing
This is not a party.. with you
If you wanna party with me
Can't afford to get this wrong
If you wanna get this on

Pop,"Flashback to the summer
It was you and me
I just wanna know, babe
Why you switched up on me
We would spend the whole day
Walking on the beach
I thought we were ok
Now you're just my old thing


Now I see you're out with the crew
And I don't even know what to do
All I ever wanted was you, but now
The only thing I ever think about


It's everything that you do
The city lights don't shine as bright like when I'm with you, babe
It's like you're acting brand new
I remember all the times you said you'd never change
Girl, why you acting brand new?
Say, why you acting brand new?
Girl, why you acting brand new?
Tell me why you're acting brand new


Riding through your city
Riding through your town
Wonder if you're still around
Wonder if you're here now
Maybe if I call you
We can talk it out
Baby, we can't play these games
No


Now I see you're out with the crew
And I don't even know what to do
All I ever wanted was you, but now
The only thing I ever think about


It's everything that you do
The city lights don't shine as bright like when I'm with you, babe
It's like you're acting brand new
I remember all the times you said you'd never change
Girl, why you acting brand new?
Say, why you acting brand new?
Girl, why you acting brand new?
Tell me why you're acting brand new


Brand new
Brand new
B-b-b-brand new
Brand new
B-b-brand new
No, no, no
B-b-b-brand new
B-b-brand new


It's everything that you do
The city lights don't shine as bright like when I'm with you, babe
It's like you're acting brand new
I remember all the times you said you'd never change
Girl, why you acting brand new?
Say, why you acting brand new?
Girl, why you acting brand new?
Tell me why you're acting brand new


Brand new"
Pop,"Scared little girl living on a big old world
You've outgrown your room
It all happened way too soon

They took away your innocence,
But we forgot our strong defense
If I didn't get sieved in this,
I'd be lonely.

So whether you're a blue sky smiling
Or whether you're a grey sky crying
I look up to you
I look up to you
Whether you're the sunlight shining down
Or you hide behind a cloud
I look up to you
I look up to you

How do you repay a love song by the grave?
You hold out your hand and send me to sleep
But we won't let it get the best of us,
We won't fade away like dirt road dust
Cuz no matter what love still remains

So whether you're a blue sky smiling
Or whether you're a grey sky crying
I look up to you
I look up to you
Whether you're the sunlight shining down
Or you hide behind a cloud
I look up to you
I look up to you

Southern days
Your silly face
In our memories they can't replace.
No one else can take their place
But you

So whether you're a blue sky smiling
Or whether you're a grey sky crying
I look up to you
I look up to you
Whether you're the sunlight shining down
Or you hide behind a cloud
I look up to you
I look up to you"
Pop,"Eyes like fire - Burn desire
As we dance away into the night
This attraction - Fuels a passion
That's just too strong for us to try and fight

Each moment we're together
I just never want to end
'Cause I could never feel this way again

'Cause nothing else had ever felt so right
To feel your body lying next to mine
As the rhythm of your heart beats through me
All through the night
I never thought I'd ever realize
A love that feels so close to paradise
Boy I could spend my whole life living
Forever in your eyes

Lips so tender - I surrender
Everything I am is yours alone
When you touch me - All that I see
Are feelings that my heart has never known
You're all I ever dreamed of
you're my every fantasy
Whoever thought one angel could bring heaven here to me

'Cause nothing else had ever felt so right
To feel your body lying next to mine
As the rhythm of your heart beats through me
All through the night
I never thought I'd ever realize
A love that feels so close to paradise
Boy I could spend my whole life living
Forever in your eyes

You're the one my heart beats for
You're my everything and more
It's a burnin' love I can't seem to ignore
Cause all the things I feel inside
Are too strong for me to hide (baby)
I need you by my side
'Cause I could live forever in your eyes

'Cause nothing else had ever felt so right
To feel your body lying next to mine
As the rhythm of your heart beats through me
All through the night
I never thought I'd ever realize
A love that feels so close to paradise
Boy I could spend my whole life living
Forever in your eyes

Forever in your eyes
Forever in your eyes
Forever in your eyes
Forever in your eyes
Forever in your eyes"
Pop,"When i first saw you i already knew
I was breakin my own heart when i fell for you
I meant to be moment of lovers taboo
When i let my mind wander it brings me right back there to you

What a beautiful house with the city lights few
No white picket fence
No porch swing for two
But the lights they just sparkle like your eyes used to do
When i let my mind wander it brings me right back there to you

I'll get away here's my chance to be free
Cause i can't feel tied down to something i don't see
But why do i stay married?
??
When i let my mind wander it brings me right back there to you
When i let my mind wander it brings me right back

How will find me through the thunder and the rain
Cast away these clouds filled with so much pain
Every time that i ....
Every time that i cry
Every time that i say goodbye
It's cause i'm missin you
I'm missin you

When my mind wanders baby
It brings me right back

I should find peace in the still of the night
I lie awake cause you're not by my side
These arms of mine left empty cause you're not in my life
When i let my mind wander it brings me right back there to you"

So instead, I think I'll just write you a letter

Missy elliot rap
Top, top on the shock on the spot
Raven loves six so here comes the doc
Well lil' raven come and get your shovel and dig this
We top the seuss kick

Never fell in love with tamika through
it was my teacher too much for me to lead up to
They used to tell me you'll be seuss when your older
If you take the time and be patient
when your all grown up you can find love and take it

Cause I'm cute, leave the seuss
I'm too old for you but I can dig it for the crew
We can go cruising' on my jet
We can play ninjas on three
Off for some popcorn and some ice cream
and I can be your little ice cream dreams

Ooh I got a crush on you
I betcha didn't know
Ooh I got a crush on you
Yesterday at school I saw you as you passed me by
And all your girls they were calling you names
But I still think your fly"

Pop,"Baby, I will love you
So I can, always, kiss you
I swear, I won't lose you
Because I like only you

Someday I will hold you
I'll kiss you, I'll conquer you
Because I can't live without you
Who knows I can find you
see you, touch you
Because I love you

Maybe you love me as I love you
And if you love me, could I kiss you?
My life without you is like not having a life
Only near you I can survive

Baby, I will love you
So I can, always, kiss you
I swear, I won't lose you
Because I like only you

Someday I will hold you
I'll kiss you, I'll conquer you
Because I can't live without you
Who knows I can find you

Maybe you love me as I love you
And if you love me, could I kiss you?

Pop,"And the fishermen came back across the water
And the people started running in the park
And the city stopped, as I held you in my arms
We could hear the sound of sirens all around us
And the scent of burning oil was in the air
And the music played
And it felt so good to hear

This is the life we've been given
So open your mind and start living
We can play a part if we only start believing

There's a stranger on the hill and he is speaking
As the tear from every cloud begin to fall
For one moment then, we understood it all

Everyone, everyone, can you hear the soldiers coming
Everyone, everyone, every man and every women
We all fall, in the end we're just miracles of matter
So come on, let me love you

This is the life we've been given
So open your mind and start living
We can play a part if we only start believing
This is the life we've been given
So open your heart and start loving
We can make a start if we only learn to listen

Then the crowd began to head for the horizon
A million people walking back to work
But you and me, we just lay down in the garden
Yeah you and me, we just lay down in the garden

This is the life we've been given
So open your heart and start loving
We can make a start if we only learn to listen

You and me, we just lay down in the garden
Yeah, the garden"
Pop,"It was so easy that night,
Should have been strong, yeah I lied,
Nobody gets me like you,

I know everything changes,
All the cities and faces,
But I know how I feel about you,

Can we bring yesterday back around,
'Cus I know how I feel about you now,
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down,
But I know how I feel about you now

All that it takes one more chance,
Don't let our last kiss be our last,
Give me tonight and I'll show you

I know everything changes,
I don't care where it takes us,
'Cus I know how I feel about you

Can we bring yesterday back around,
'Cus I know how I feel about you now,
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down,
But I know how I feel about you now

Not a day pass me by,
Not a day pass me by,
When I don't think about you,
And there's no moving on,
'Cus I know you're the one,
And I can't be without you

Can we bring yesterday back around,
'Cus I know how I feel about you now,
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down,
But I know how I feel about you now

Can we bring yesterday back around,
'Cus I know how I feel about you now,

Yes I know how I feel about you now"
Pop,"Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby
Do you recognize me?
Well
It's been a year
It doesn't surprise me
(Merry Christmas)

I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, 'I love you'
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kiss me now
You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Special

A crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
My god I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart, ooh-hoo
Cause now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (gave it away)
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
I gave you my heart
You gave me away

Ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo

Pop,"Love love, everybody, everybody
Love love everybody, is pink
Love love everybody, everybody
Love love everybody, is pink

Thinking about the way that I can say,
Maybe there's more to me than you see baby,
So many different ways to misbehave,
Big numbers and I will make it eighty

Dance on the spot,
Givin it all we got
Fire in my eyes, baby I can't disguise
That deal that we did, gettin' me in the mood
If I could make a man he'd look a lot like you

My love is pink, everybody knows what you think
My love is white, but it won't amount to much tonight
My love is red
Hotter than the terrible things you said
My love is light, the colours of the girls oh what hold tight

Talkin about what's never gone before,
Lettin' you work your way around my body.
Whatever you got I'm guessing I got more.
Even with no regrets you won't be sorry.

Dance on the spot,
Givin' it all we got
Fire in my eyes, baby I can't disguise
That deal that we did, gettin' me in the mood
If I could make a man he'd look a lot like you

My love is pink, everybody knows what you think
My love is white, but it won't amount to much tonight
My love is red
Hotter than the terrible things you said
My love is light, the colors of the girls oh what hold tight

And I'll be true, true to my word
Oh baby, I will be true
If you, give me your word,
Then maybe, I'll show you the moves

Love, love everybody, everybody
Love, love everybody, is pink
Love, love everybody, everybody
Love, love everybody, is pink

My love is pink, everybody knows what you think
My love is white, but it won't amount to much tonight
My love is red
Hotter than the terrible things you said
My love is light, the colours of the girls oh what hold tight

Pop,"Swim the river when the bridge is gone
I got the fever and I'm comin on
feel the power in my flesh and bone
through the fire and the fallen stone

Up the alley and the dirty back roads
all the places that nobody knows
got to make it just another mile
gonna be there in a little while

If the end has come
If the end has come
If the end has come
I want to be by your side

River burning and the trees are dyin'
tearing open with an angry sign
hands they tremble and hearts they race
I won't rest until I see your face

Coming for you in the blazing night
hold your body in the fading light
I'll beg and steal if that's what it takes
I may stumble but I will not break

If the end has come
If the end has come
If the end has come
I want to be by your side

Through the tunnel on my hands and knees
people crying and they're begging please
feel the power in my flesh and bone
through the fire and the fallen stone

All the places that nobody knows
up the alley and the dirty back roads
got to make it just another mile
got to be there in a little while

Coming for you in the blazing night
hold your body in the fading light
rivers burning and the trees are dyin'
tearing open with an angry sign

Walls may crumble and the ground may shake
I'll beg and steal if that's what it takes
hands they tremble and hearts they race
I won't rest until I see your face

If the end has come
If the end has come
If the end has come
I want to be by your side

If the end has come
If the end has come
If the end has come
I want to be by your side"
Pop,"Accidentally made a joke
that killed your boner
And I woke up so hungover
And I didn't even drink so much last night
And I hurt your feelings on the phone
'cause I'm pmsing
And you sent the sweetest message
I forgot to reply
and I couldn't even tell you why

Most days I'm hilarious, confident
and I don't get jealous
And I'm sexy and I'm fun
Most days I'm affectionate
and I love you like I invented it
I'm not usually this dumb, but

I'm just not killin' it today
No, today is not my day
Hahaha gotta laugh
Someone please, give me a break
It's written on my face
I wanna cry and eat some cake
Try again tomorrow babe
I'm not killing it today
No no no no no, No no no no no no
No no, no
I'm not killin' it today

Accidentally I sneezed and peed little
Looked in the mirror and my eyes jiggled
And it helps when you tell me I'm perfect
but not this time

Most days I'm hilarious, confident
and I don't get jealous
And I'm sexy and I'm fun
Most days I'm affectionate
and I love you like I invented it
I'm not usually this dumb, but

I'm just not killin' it today
No, today is not my day
Hahaha gotta laugh
Someone please, give me a break
It's written on my face
I wanna cry and eat some cake

No no no no no, no no no no no no
No no, no

I'm just not killin' it today
No, today is not my day

Someone please, give me a break
It's written on my face
I wanna cry and eat some cake
Try again tomorrow babe

No no no no no, no no no no no no
No no, no

No no no no no, no no no no no no
No no, no
I'm not killin' it today"
Pop,"Almost got what I want
Almost found what I lost
Almost saved you and myself
Almost won but it doesn't count
And never does
Never does

One green light
One more ring of the telephone
One more step
One more second
And I almost
Almost

Almost got what I want
Almost found what I lost
Almost saved you and myself
Almost won but it doesn't count
And never does
Never does

One hello
Just one kiss before the tears come
One yes
One chance
And I almost
Almost almost almost

Almost got what I want
Almost found what I lost
Almost saved you and myself
Almost won but it doesn't count
And never does
Never does

One day one year
5,000 weeks
A life of good works and good deeds
Let me be let me be closer
Or let me be
Let me be
Let me be

When I've almost got what I want
Almost found what I lost
Almost saved you and myself
Almost won but it doesn't count
And never does
Never does

One good guess
A question with an answer that I know
One idea
One grand notion
And I almost
Almost almost almost

Almost got what I want
Almost found what I lost
Almost saved you and myself
Almost won but it doesn't count
And never does
Never does
Never does
Never does"
Pop,"You've got a hold of me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around you

Show me an open door
Then you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore
I'm saying baby

Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy
Mercy on my heart
Would you please have mercy
Mercy on my heart

I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you baby
Heart open and testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy

I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
My pride Is all I got
I'm saying baby

Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free

Would you please have mercy
Mercy on my heart
Would you please have mercy
Mercy on my heart

Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice

Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free

I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
On my heart
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
On my heart"
Pop,"I was a man who always played around in love

so quick to take
but so afraid to give enough.
But now
I've found the one
and heaven will only know
what only my eyes can say and time can't take away.

I was a girl who trusted no one with my heart

and the dreams that young girls dream were just vanishing in the
dark.
But now
I've found the one
and heaven will only know
what only my eyes can say
they say -

That I will take you forever

and there will never be anyone else in my heart but you.
And I will take you forever

and there will never be anyone else but you
anyone else but you.

Now my touch belongs to you and I will always be your best friend

now my secrets are safe with you and the magic will never end.
Now you are the one
and heaven will only know
what only our eyes can say
they say -

That I will take you forever

and there will never be anyone else in my heart but you.
And I will take you forever

and there will never be anyone else but you
anyone else but you

anyone else but you.

That I will take you forever
...
That I will take you forever
...
That I will take you forever

"
Pop,"If I die in New York city
Bury me on the Battery
The pretty girls on Brooklyn ferry
Ask them all to weep for me

I'll be smiling brother
When they lay me down
Cause I lived my life
In New York town

Say it again

I'll be smiling brother
When they lay me down
Cause I lived my life
In New York town

And I'll be smiling brother
When they lay me down
Cause I lived my life
In New York town

I'll be smiling brother
When they lay me down
Cause I lived my life
In New York town

Because I lived my life
In New York town"
Pop,"Just girl to boy
I'd like to share this thought with you
Our love's a joy
Two one's have made inseparable two
Last night my heart spoke to me
And it said
You've found that lover-friend
So now I've finally got the courage
Just ask You Baby ooh

chorus:
Will you, will you
Will you marry me boy
Will you, will you
Will you marry me
Will you, will you
Will you marry me boy
Will you, will
Will you, will you, will you
Come on byby now


I lay awake
So full with hope of things to come
For heaven's sake
I pray I'm not the only one
I never dreamed I'd be so bold
I'm standing here, my heart's been sold
So now I've finally got the courage
Just ask you baby ooh

chorus


Think of love as wings
Not a ball and chain
And Your fear of things
Unnecessary
I only want to share your name
Share your name
Last night my heart spoke to me
And it said
You've found that lover-friend
So now I've finally got the courage
Just ask You Baby ooh

chorus

Maybe sunday
Come on monday
Baby any time this week
Get an old house
Find a back Yard
Buy some flowers down street
Tell your mother
Tell your mother
Don't tell anyone at all
All we need is
Just the two of us
and ooh...
"
Pop,"I don't know when we fell apart
The love that we had was like a work of art
I used to see heaven in your eyes
Now angels are falling from your skies

The things we said were so wrong
And I haven?t held you for so long
My foolish pride turns me inside
Why did we tell all those lies
If you can reach for the phone
You don?t have to be alone

Outside the wind it seems so cold
Your heart is frozen like the snow (snow)
And there?s no one home to keep you safe and warm
Your eyes are red because you?ve cried (cried)
You fell asleep by the fireside (fireside)
but there?s one thing you should know
On this Christmas baby, you don?t have to be alone

And I had only one wish on my list
For me you would be the perfect gift
There?s nothing colder than an empty home
(empty home)
And holidays were never meant to be alone
(to be alone)
The smiles we gave when our hearts were saved
By each others? love and warmth
That's subsided now no happiness around
If I can only find a way to your heart

Outside the wind it seems so cold
Your heart is frozen like the snow
And there?s no one home to keep you safe and warm
Your eyes are red because you?ve cried
You fell asleep by the fireside
but there?s one thing you should know
on this Christmas baby, you don?t have to be alone

(Bridge:)
You don?t have to be alone
You don?t have to be all alone (at Christmas)
You don?t have to be alone
You don?t have to be all alone

Outside the wind it seems so cold
Your heart is frozen like the snow
And there?s no one home to keep you safe and warm
Your eyes are red because you?ve cried
You fell asleep by the fireside
but there?s one thing you should know
on this Christmas baby, you don?t have to be alone"
Pop,"all the ladies, on the lake they start to dance

always waiting for my lucky day

But you're my style, can't live without it
I need your heart, no way around it
So baby tell me, tell me, tell me that it's on tonight

Whisper your nasty little secrets in my ear
Tell me your passion, I'll make it happen
If you don't know then let me make it crystal clear

What keeps you awake at night
What makes you want to breakdown and cry

Say you'll never harden to the world
Say you'll never try to still the rhythms in your breast
Say you'll never look at the evil among us and try to forget
Say you'll tell it like it is
Say it say it say it so everyone can hear
Say it say it say it tell it like it is
What breaks your hear
What keeps you awake at night
How your anger and grief
Make you want to cry out
And tell it like it is
But say you'll never close your eyes
Or pretend that it's a rosy world
Say you'll never try to paint
What is rotten with a sugarcoat
Say you'll talk about the horrors you've seen and the torment you know
And tell it like it is

Say it say it say it
So no one can forget
Say it say it say it Tell it like it is
What breaks your heart
What keeps you awake at night
What makes you want to break the ties that silence and bind
And tell it like it is
Say you'll never cover your ears and close your mouth
And live in a silent world
Say you'll only run as far or as fast as you need to be secure
Say that then you'll tell the truth
When a lie could cross your lips
And tell it like it is

Say it say it say it - Say it say it say it
Say it say it say it - Say it say it say it
Say it say it say it - Say it say it say it
Say it say it say it - Say it say it say it"

We could make it better sometime
Maybe we could make it happen baby

So I don't look back
Still I'm dying with every step I take
But I don't look back
Just a little, little bit better

Good enough to waste some time
Tell me would it make you happy baby
We could keep trying

So I don't look back

So tell the voice inside ya' head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you
So I can say

Hello my only one, just like the morning sun
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
""Hey, hey, one day you'll be the man you always knew you could be? ""
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

Hello my only one, remember who you are
You got the world cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand

So hear me out, hear me out
I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly

Hello my only one, just like the morning sun
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are
No, you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori ab
I just want you to do me a favor
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me"
Pop,"Why do I keep my mind on you all the time
And I don't even know you
Why do I feel this way
Thinking about you every day
And I don't even know you
Take me in your arms
Thrill me with all of your charms

And I'll take to the sky on a natural high
(I want to take to the sky)
Loving you more 'till the day I die
(On the natural high)
Take to the sky on a natural high
(I want you to be mine)
Loving you more.

If you have anything to do
Call me and I will do it for you
And I don't even know you
If I only had one wish to give
That wish would be for you to live forever and ever.
When I see you on the street
My heart skips a beat

And I'll take to the sky on a natural high
(I'll just take to the sky)
Loving you more till the day I die
(on a natural high)
Take to the sky on a natural high
(Loving you more and I don't know you)
Loving you more

I'm gonna try to do
All the things you want me to
If you'll just give me a chance
I'm trying to make something out of a nothing romance
And I don't even know you
Take me in your arms
Thrill me with all of your charms

And I'll take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more 'till the day I die
(To the sky)
I'll take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more

And I'll take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more 'till the day I die
I'll take to the sky on a natural high
Loving loving you
I'll take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more 'till the day I die
I'll take to the sky on a natural high
Loving loving you"
Pop,"I met my match in a pretty face
Feels like you're playing my part
Can't figure out if I like the chase
Can't figure out who you are

And all the mirrors
Always make me think about you
Cause I'm not used to losing at my own games
And all the mirrors show your face
When I'm without you
It all starts to look the same
(this way) this way

Taking my mind out of limbo
Throwing my pride out the window
Why do you keep on breaking rules?
I'm not the only one to make a move
Penny for a dime for the win, oh
Crossed another line like you didn't know
Why do you keep on breaking rules?
I guess I'm not the only one who's smooth

I guess I'm not the only one who's smooth

I guess I'm not the only one who's smooth

I met my match in a pretty face
Still wondering if you're real
Can't figure out if it's love or hate
Can't figure out how I feel

And all the mirrors
Always make me think about you
It all starts to look the same
(this way) this way

Taking my mind out of limbo
Throwing my pride out the window
Why do you keep on breaking rules?
I'm not the only one to make a move
Penny for a dime for the win, oh
Crossed another line like you didn't know
Why do you keep on breaking rules?
I guess I'm not the only one who's smooth

I guess I'm not the only one who's smooth

I guess I'm not the only one who's smooth

And as I play it all back in my mind
I start to wonder if you're here
Here this whole time
And as I play it all back in my mind
As I play it all back
[backwards:] as I play it back in my mind

Taking my mind out of limbo
Throwing my pride out the window
Why do you keep on breaking rules?
I'm not the only one to make a move
Penny for a dime for the win, oh
Crossed another line like you didn't know
Why do you keep on breaking rules?
I guess I'm not the only one who's smooth

I guess I'm not the only one who's smooth

I guess I'm not the only one who's smooth

Oh baby
I guess I'm not the only one who's smooth
Yeah"
Pop,"Uh

*laugh*

Oh

Hey yeah yeah

Girl when we started baby we were friends
But that's not how this fairy tale is gonna end
See I was thinking then it clicked one day
(clicked one day)
That no one else has ever made me feel this way
Next time I saw you girl I knew I had to try
To tell you everything that I was feeling deep inside
And listen good 'cause what I say is from my heart
So if you're ready

You see I toss and turn when I'm alone
And I just can't wait 'til you get home
Waiting for your call (ooh) 'cause tonight we're gonna do it all
Girl it's just the two of us
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout you day and night
And I just can't get you off my mind
When you get a minute (ooh) baby I was thinking we could hook up
It's just the two of us, the two of us
'Cause in a room full of people you're the only one around
And nothing in this world could ever bring us down
Baby I'll be there telling you I care
This I swear
Girl it's just the two of us, the two of us

Baby I wonder if you feel the same as I do
I wonder if you're going through the things I'm going through
I sent you flowers on a Saturday (Saturday)
Inside's a letter with a message and no name
See I just love the feeling, knowing that I can make you smile
And I haven't felt that way about someone in quite a while
Just listen to these words I have to say (ooh)
Just take a chance (take a chance)

You see I toss and turn when I'm alone
And I just can't wait 'til you get home
Waiting for your call (ooh) 'cause tonight we're gonna do it all
Girl it's just the two of us
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout you day and night
And I just can't get you off my mind
When you get a minute (ooh) baby I was thinking we could hook up
It's just the two of us, the two of us
'Cause in a room full of people you're the only one around
And nothing in this world could ever bring us down
Baby I'll be there telling you I care
This I swear
Girl it's just the two of us, the two of us

It just gets better with each day (maybe someday)
I always wanted to tell you
But I was so afraid

You see I toss and turn when I'm alone
And I just can't wait 'til you get home
Waiting for your call (waiting for your call)
(ooh) 'cause tonight we're gonna do it all
(gonna do it all)
Girl it's just the two of us
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout you day and night
And I just can't get you off my mind
When you get a minute (ooh) baby I was thinking we could hook up
(oh yeah)
It's just the two of us, the two of us
'Cause in a room full of people you're the only one around
And nothing in this world could ever bring us down
Baby I'll be there telling you I care
This I swear (I swear)
Girl it's just the two of us, the two of us

Oh

Hey yea yeah
"
Pop,"Everybody's writing on the wall
Taking all day long to read it all
Staring in the face of what's to come
Coming down I've set the space for you

Up, up
Thought you wanted to be up
Thought you wanted to be loved
Don't you want to be loved?

Who could live without the harmony
The hundred million years of history
It's only coming down to you and me
Give me time and I'll make it up to you

Up, up
Thought you wanted to be up
Thought you wanted to be loved
Don't you want to be loved?

Reaching up to turn the clock around
It's like a letter to my heart
A feeling that I got when I was young
Like the days, the days
Were folding up into my pocket
When honestly I wouldn't change a single thing about the time we had

Up, up
Thought you wanted to be up
Thought you wanted to be loved
Don't you want to be loved?
Don't you want to be
Up, up
Thought you wanted to be up
Thought you wanted to be loved
Don't you want to be loved?"
Pop,"I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

Yeah, and nothing stays the same
If you're ready for love be ready for all the pain
Got a taste of the fame and look at who I became
A grown-ass man playing Immature games
I feel stupid, how the hell could I do this?
I knew that you were clueless and all I did was abuse it
I know that it was foolish, I know that it was ruthless
But if I really knew it, why the hell did I go through it?
I remember when you called I told you that I was sleeping
But other girls I was meeting I was too busy cheating
And it just kept repeating and repeating
like every single evening
To the point I didn't even give a damn if you were leaving
But I do now, and now I know
You don't realize what you have 'till the day you see it go
And maybe we'll try again, forget what I did before
Forgive me for my mistakes, I guess that we'll never know
It's a story untold

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

And the story goes on, it's the same old song
Flashback to Kat when I was staying at her home
I used to sleep at hers 'cause she'd hate sleeping alone
I go and grab the cover
then a text comes through her phone
And it was from a guy who was older then me
He said ""Call me when you get this
and I'll come when he leaves""
And I just couldn't believe that she was cheating on me
And still had the f**king nerve
tha she could blame it on me
Like ""Anth what did you expect? You aint never around
It was my birthday last week you weren't even in town
And yeah, you bought me a gift but baby that wasn't s**t
I don't care about the money that you spend on my wrist
I cried so many tears because you never were here
And we talked, and we fought
but you just never appeared
I told you so many times it must have
went through your ears
Cause you don't care about us babe, only your career""
And that's real

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run"
Pop,"Oh, right now baby
As soon as the stars shine
I'm gonna make you mine, oh baby

(You got it, I want it)
(I'll do whatever it takes)
(You got it, I need it)
(Your love is what makes my heart break)

Let me tell you how I feel
I need your lovin' girl, give it to me
Never met a girl like you
I know you'll like the crazy things we'll do
(The crazy thing we'll do)

Walking slowly through the rain
Without worries there's no pain
When you see a shooting star
All your problems seem so far
If you feel true love and trust
Girl just give me all you got
'Cause girl you got the love I need

(You got it, I want it)
(I'll do whatever it takes)
Whatever it takes
(You got it, I need it)
You got it, I need it
(Your love is what makes my heart break)

You are in my dreams at night
Whatever I do, you're always on my mind
I can't wait until the day
When you and me are one in love to stay

Walking slowly through the rain
Without worries there's no pain
When you see a shooting star
All your problems seem so far
If you feel true love and trust
Girl, just give me all you've got
Girl you got the love I need

(You got it, I want it)
(I'll do whatever it takes)
Whatever it takes
(You got it, I need it)
I need it
(Your love is what makes my heart break)

You got it, yeah
(You got it, I want it)
(I'll do whatever it takes)
(You got it, I need it)
You got it
Your love is what make my heart break

(Just give me all your love)
(Got to have all your love)
(Just give me all your love)
'Cause your love is what make my heart break
(Got to have your love)
(Just give me all your love)
(I got to have all your love)
(Just give me all your love)
'Cause I got what you need, baby
(Got to have your love)

(You got it, I want it)
(I'll do whatever it takes)
'Cause I got to have your love baby
(You got it, I need it)
(Your love is what makes my heart break)
Give me your love
"
Pop,"You set my soul at ease
Chased darkness out of view
left your desperate spell on me
Say you feel it too
I know you do
I've got so much more to give
this can't die, I yearn to live
Pour yourself all over me
and I'll cherish every drop here on my knees

Chorus
I wanna love you forever
and this is all I'm asking of you
ten thousand lifetimes together
is that so much for you to do?
'Cause from the moment that I saw your face
and felt the fire in your sweet embrace
I swear I knew.
I'm gonna to love you forever.

My mind fails to understand
what my heart tells me to do
and I give up all I have just to be with you
and now I do
I've always been taught to win
and I never thought I'd fall
be at the mercy of a man
I've never been
now I only want to be right where you are.

Chorus

In my life I learned that heaven never waits, no
let's take this night before its gone like yesterday
'Cause when I'm with you
there's no where else that I would ever wanna be
I'm craving for the next second I can feel you loving me

Chorus

Forever (ooh)
I wanna love you forever
I wanna love you, boy
"
Pop,"My only reason

Love is my only reason and love can make you do crazy things
And that's why my only explanation is cuz I love you and that's all
Boy I love you and that's all

My friends think I'm crazy
Coz I'm running around with you
But they don't know you like I do, and I do
You're so impossible, so unpredictable
I know, they don't have to tell me
But my heart's made up my mind
It's so irrational, so irresponsible
It may not make sense
But it's making me feel so deep

Love is my only reason and love can make you do crazy things
And that's why my only explanation is cuz I love you and that's all
Boy I love you and that's all

3:30 in the morning and you're asking why I'm still here
My life would probably be safer if you disappear, but don't disappear no
It's like a burning flame that's stronger in the rain
I ask myself why I do this over and over again
But even with your pain
I still can't walk away until every chance is gone
I'll be here holding on

Love is my only reason and love can make you do crazy things
And that's why my only explanation is cuz I love you and that's all
Boy I love you and that's all

I don't even have a choice, I don't have a choice
These kind of situations have a life of their own
So why isn't my love enough to explain
Why am I acting this way?
Is just that...

Love is my only reason and love can make you do crazy things
And that's why my only explanation is cuz I love you and that's all
Boy I love you and that's all
"
Pop,"You must think I'm crazy
Think that I'm a fool
I'm hopelessly romantic,whenever I'm with you
To see the world through my eyes
And never look too far
We're meant to be together,it's written in the stars
We're walking the highway
Doing it our way
Nothing's ever really out of reach,oh

Baby,baby I'm not crazy
I just wear my heart on my sleeve
I never think it over or say maybe
Oh,and that's the trouble with me
I don't wanna talk it over
I carry the world on my shoulders,yeah
And baby,baby you can save me
I'll always wear my heart on my sleeve
That's the trouble with me
That's the trouble with me,yeah

I follow my emotions,they always call my name
You tell me how you're feeling,I'm sure I'll feel the same
Of dreamly constellations,you're always in my heart
The road,it always takes me back to where you are

I'm driving the highway,doing my way
When I know you're never really out of reach,oh

Baby,baby I'm not crazy
I just wear my heart on my sleeve
I never think it over or say maybe
Oh,and that's the trouble with me
I don't wanna talk it over
I carry the world on my shoulders,yeah
And baby,baby you can save me
I'll always wear my heart on my sleeve
That's the trouble with me

Oh,I never wanna calm down
Oh,I never ever wanna touch the ground again

Never learned my lesson,never wanna change
If loving you will hurt me
Give me the pain,yeah

Baby,baby I'm not crazy
I just wear my heart on my sleeve
I never think it over or say maybe
Oh,and that's the trouble with me
That's trouble with me
That's trouble with me,yeah
I don't wanna talk it over
I carry the world on my shoulders,yeah
And baby,baby you can save me
I'll always wear my heart on my sleeve
That's the trouble with me
Trouble with me
Don't leave"
Pop,"Even reading in between the lines

Every day, you hit my phone up
Every time
(You hit my phone up)
It makes my heart jump
I want you to say it, baby
(It makes my heart jump)
Say it like you mean it
It's right there on the tip of your tongue
(You hit my phone up)
And I can feel it
And I like it baby
Don't you stop
(Don't stop what you're doing, baby)
You know I like it
You stretch it out
(You know I like it)
You give massages
It's not your words

It's what's in between them
There's no need to spell out

I don't mind
(I don't really mind it baby)
When we get silent
Pressure's rising, it's so intense
(When we get silent)
We're making diamonds
There's no need to say it baby
(We're making diamonds)
'Cause I can tell you mean it
All over the tip of your tongue
(We're making diamonds)
You got me spaced out
And I like it, baby

I'm reading in between the lines

Pop,"I've been waiting all my life to fly so high
Unbeliable, now the sun is shining in my life
Every day I want you more, we will endure
Anything they say, anything they throw away
Stronger now than yesterday

Feel like I could walk across the water
Heavenly, there's not a cloud up in the sky
And I know for you there'll never be another
So the rain can fall but I would still be dry

I am basking in the light, so wonderful
I wanna celebrate everything that brought me here today
As the ocean hits the shore, forever more
I am by your side, never cross the borderline
Love you till the end of the time

Feel like I could walk across the water
Heavenly, there's not a cloud up in the sky
And I know for you there'll never be another
So the rain can fall but I would still be dry

And baby when I think of you my heart is open
And I do believe that things will never change
Even though our words of love remain unspoken
I look in your eyes and know you feel the same

I wanna stay here forever
Your love is making me better
I wanna stay here forever
And love you today

I wanna stay here forever
Your love is making me better
I wanna stay here forever
(Yeah-yeah)

I wanna stay here forever
(I wanna stay here with you)
Your love is making me better
(Wanna love you everyday)
I wanna stay here forever
(Whoa-yea-yeah)

I wanna stay here forever
(I wanna stay here with you)
Your love is making me better
(I wanna love you everyday)
I wanna stay here forever

"
Pop,"Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be?
You're not here with me

You never said good-bye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go?
And leave my world so cold?

Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away?
Something whispers
In my ear and says:

That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

You are not alone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms

I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away?
Something whispers
In my ear and says:

But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

You are not alone

Oh, whisper three words
And I'll come running
And boy you know
That I'll be there, I'll be there

But you are not alone
We are here for you
Though you're far away
We are here to stay

You are not alone
We are here for you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

You are not alone
(You are not)
You are not alone"
Pop,"I understand your point of view letting me go

But I thought you had more faith

Everything I´ve done for you

You made the mistakes and now you throw this in my face

And I have worked so hard for you all of this time and you cast me aside

I understand your point of view


Chorus:
But I can´t seem to get my head around

All the things that I feel good about always seem to disappear

And every time I think I´ve got this all worked out

Something chews me up and spits me out

But there´s nothing left to fear

I´m better alone my dear



You couldn't pick a better time to give me the news

Why don´t you kick me when I´m down?

I´d always believed in you

Defended your name but you have not been true

I gave you so much of my life I´ve compromised and you tell me goodbye

You couldn´t pick a better time


Chorus:
And I can´t seem to get my head around

All the things that I feel good about always seem to disappear

And every time I think I´ve got this all worked out

Something chews me up and spits me out

But there´s nothing left to fear

I´m better alone my dear



I know I really should thank you for setting me free

It´s really amazing the changes I´m starting to feel

It's not gonna be long till I´m fit and strong

Deliverance helped me heal still I wonder if you ever wish you still had me



Will I ever get my head around

All the things that I feel good about that always seem to disappear

When every time I think I´ve got this all worked out

Something chews me up and spits me out

But there´s nothing left to fear

No No No



I can´t seem to get my head around

All the things that I feel good about that always seem to disappear

No No



And every time I think I´ve got this figured out

Something screws me up and drags me down

But there´s nothing left to fear

I´m better alone my dear"
Pop,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe, mm-mm
Helps to make the seasons bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that (San—, san—) , Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies for his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna try
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Ooh, ah-ooh
Ah

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you"
Pop,"I can be so negative, sometimes
My own worst enemy, sometimes
Even at my lowest low,
You still had hope

When I wanna quit,
You won't let me.
When I'm falling down,
You gon' catch me.
You pick me up
Yeah, you fix me up
Now I'm on my way,
And I'm strong enough to say

You gave me wings and taught me to fly
When I was out there on my own
You gave me wings and brought me to life
And now I need to know
If you wanna fly cause I wanna fly, Yeah
Tell me you're down for touching the sky, Yeah
You and Me, Me and You
The higher, the better
When we fly, we fly together, together, together, together, together
When we fly we fly together..

I feel like a prisoner, locked up
The only key to set me free is your love
You went and took a chance on me,
Without a reason to believe

When I wanna quit,
You won't let me.
When I'm falling down,
You gon' catch me.
You pick me up
Yeah, you fix me up
Now I'm on my way,

You won't let me.
When I'm falling down,
You gon' catch me.
You pick me up
Yeah, you fix me up
Now I'm on my way,
And I'm strong enough to say

You gave me wings and taught me to fly
When I was out there on my own
You gave me wings and brought me to life
And now I need to know
If you wanna fly cause I wanna fly, Yeah
Tell me you're down for touching the sky, Yeah
You and Me, Me and You
The higher, the better
When we fly, we fly together, together, together, together, together

When we fly we fly together, together, together, together, forever
When We fly we fly together!"
Pop,"All I need is one
One old man is enough
Babe, you got it wrong
Please turn your fears into trust, to trust

Where'd the love go
When all is said and done

Hey now I got your hands in the air
I'mma go through your stuff

Where'd the love go
You put the running into run

You asking me to stay
But I never met a girl I could trust

You're sayin' those words
Like you hate me now
Our house is burning
When you're raised in hell

Here in the ashes your soul cries out
But don't be afraid of these thunderclouds

These thunderclouds oh no
These thunderclouds oh no no

All I need is love
All I need is a word
All I need is us
You turned nouns into verbs, to verbs

Where'd the love go
When all is said and…

Hey now put your hands in the air
I'mma go through your stuff

Where'd the love go
You put the running into run
You're asking me to stay
But I never met a man I could trust

You're sayin' those words
Like you hate me now
Our house is burning
When you're raising hell

Here in the ashes your soul cries out
But don't be afraid of these thunderclouds

These thunderclouds
Oh noo, these thunderclouds
Ohh, these thunderclouds

Ohh no, these thunderclouds
Ohh no, these thunderclouds

These thunderclouds

You're sayin' those words
Like you hate me now
Our house is burning
When you're raising hell

Here in the ashes your soul cries out
But don't be afraid of these thunderclouds

These thunderclouds
Oh noo, these thunderclouds
Ohh, these thunderclouds

Ohh no, these thunderclouds
Ohh no no, these thunderclouds"

Baby when it's just us
We'll be testing
Like there ain't no stopping us
Official is my definition
If you don't agree
Then that's your grief
The fun will seize
Boy

It's not attraction that is missing
(the intensity is there)
And the kissing is amazing
(I just wish we would beware)
We're fine to show our feelings babe
No games, I'm done with playing those
We should - just be - friends.

Treat me like a yo-yo

If we're not official I'm so much better off solo

Boys are going crazy on a day to day basis
(and it don't stop)
I just click and erase,
Until they not try to trigger
Try'na get in my knickers

Pop,"Don't ask her how she knows, but she knows
It's gonna be great
Don't ask her how she knows, but she knows
And she can't wait
Hey hey hey to flyaway
Number one for takeoff
To that big drowning pool in the sky
Number one for takeoff
And her dress wavin' you goodbye
Hey hey hey flyaway
Gone up in rapture
Gone see Your mother
Take off your heavy head
Gone up in rapture
Life's better when you're dead
Bones light as eggshells
Look down on Main Street
See all the people run
Laugh if you want to
She's goin' to the sun
Hey hey hey flyaway

Pop,"Something must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feeling all the highs, feeling all the pain

Let go on the wheel
it's the bullet lane
Now I'm seeing red, not thinking straight
Blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me

Just like nicotine, rushin' me, touching me
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit
and you will know I'll never be the same

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit, and you will know
I'll never ever, ever be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

Sneaking in L. A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch I could overdose
You said, ""stop playing it safe
Girl, I wanna see you lose control""

Just like nicotine, rushin' me, touching me
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

It's you, babe

Pop,"It's funny how your life can change
Memories of love remain, inside your heart for all this time
At last you find a different road and suddenly you're not alone
A game of love rests upon your mind.......

I could feel, the love like steel
It's like a sense you have inside, you never knew
How can it be
That you love me
All that I've seen
Who really want your love and all
How can it be
That you and me
So desperately need each other every day
And what does it mean that you want me
Now it's for real today

At time it's easy to forget
All the things you once regret and
never learn to pay the price
Some day the rain will fall within
Remember face it don't give in
And watch the bad times pass you by

I could feel, the love like steel
It's like a sense you have inside, you never knew

How can it be
That you love me
All that I've seen
Who really want your love and ohh
How can it be
That you and me
So desperately need each other every day
And what does it mean that you want me
Now it's for real today
"
Pop,"What would I do if I was you
I'd come out and say what I wanted to
I'd be all the man you'd never be
So why don't you get up and groove with me

Give it up, give it out
Let it burn, let it shout
Stay'n alive to survive
Bein' pretty
Feelin' chic, like Le Freak
You will jump to the beat
Let your young hearts run free

Everybody come on let's get G.A.Y.
(G.A.Y., ooh-ooh-ooh)
Throw out bad times, kiss yourself and say goodbye, G.A.Y.
(G.A.Y.)

What would you do if you were me
Are you ready to face what you wanna be
And nothin's enough when it's just too long
So get up and go wild and get it on

Give it up, give it out
Let it burn, let it shout
Stay'n alive to survive
Bein' pretty
Feelin' chic, like Le Freak
You will jump to the beat
Let your young hearts run free

Everybody come on let's get G.A.Y.

Kiss yourself goodbye
"
Pop,"Let it in, breathe it out
Exhale the things that I've done
I'm so fucking careful
Weighed down by the undertone
God, I wish I was numb
Familiar burden

In a crowd, in a room, you're alone
No matter where you are
I see exit signs, but there's no way out

I wanna run, I wanna hide
A heart is shaking, hear me breaking
Snaking without making a sound
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
No mistaking you're overtaking
Without me letting my guard down
Why do you do this to me?

I sense you begin to leave
Oh, I know you're rotten
The one thing I'm certain
Relief as you lose your grip
But the damage is done
Exposed and I'm hurting

In a crowd, in a room, you're alone
No matter where you are
I see exit signs, but there's no way out

I wanna run, I wanna hide
A heart is shaking, hear me breaking
Snaking without making a sound
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
No mistaking, you're overtaking
Without me letting my guard down
Why do you do this to me?
Why do you do this to me?

Don't wanna freak out
I gotta prevail, I gotta prevail
Don't wanna freak out
I gotta prevail, I gotta prevail

I wanna run, I wanna hide
A heart is shaking, hear me breaking
Snaking without making a sound
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
No mistaking, you're overtaking
Without me letting my guard down
Why do you do this to me?
Why do you do this to me?"
Pop,"Well maybe it's your mind
Telling you all of the lies
Trying to show you what's right
Ohh
Well maybe you're alright
Maybe you fell out of love
But I'm not giving up

And I wonder where you are now
Don't let go
I'm still here
Waiting for your broken words
Trying to put them together again
Please take time
To realize
Nothing matters any more
We should fix our puzzle again

I'm forced to hide my pain
I'm forced to hide my cries
Can't handle anymore lies
And I'm lost in the showers crying for hours
Cuz no one can tell I'm gone
And I, I've never felt so wrong
And I wonder where you are now

Don't let go
I'm still here
Waiting for your broken words
Trying to put them together again
Please take time
To realize
Nothing matters any more
We should fix our puzzle again
Don't let me go I'm still here
Nothing matters anymore
Let's fix the broken puzzle again"

Pop,"None of these boys can dance
Not a single one of dem stand a chance
All of dem girls, a mess
I?ve seen it all before, I?m not impressed

None of dem get my sex
None of dem move my intellect
None of dem work for me
None of dem make me feel anything

I?m so bored in this town, take me away from here
Playing some kind of new sound, something true and
sincere
I?ve got a little girl singing on repeat in my head,
oh oh
Take me far away from here

None of dem get my stands
None of dem do it like I can
None of these chicks got style
None of these drugs get me high

None of these beats are raw
None of these beats ever break the law
None of dem kicks go boom
None of dem basslines fill the room

I?m so bored in this town, take me away from here
Playing some kind of new sound, something true and
sincere
I?ve got a little girl singing on repeat in my head,

Take me far away from here"
Pop,"chorus:
Lumina
Come and wrap around me
Lumina
Take me through the snow

Eve take a train, Eve took a train
Went to see her man
Melting inside, melting away
Like butter in the pan

(chorus)

Eve took a fruit, Eve bit the fruit
Just ran down her chin
Babies will put things in their mouths
Never heard of sin

Lumina
Open like the sea
Lumina
sing me in the dark

Eve had to ask, Eve had to ask
What is wrong with this?
Here is the place, now is the time

Pop,"Calling all the girls
There's an SOS tonight, let's have some fun
One hundred percent
Every single chase somehow these days are gone, yeah

There's gonna be a million faces up in this room ooh
But the only one who gets my attention is you, you

I got my best on
And I feel like dancing all night long
Nothing's gonna stop me
Oh but I want
So baby come and get me
'Cause I don't wanna dance alone
Oh it's been so long
Thinking 'bout the feeling of your arms
Wrapped around my body
It's what I want
So baby come and get me
'Cause I don't wanna dance alone

And on the floor
I can feel you staring at me across the room, ooh
Whatcha waiting for
All I want is you so come and make a move

I see a million silver lights up in this room, ooh
I wanna be the one who gets the attention from you, oh

I got my best on
And I feel like dancing all night long
Nothing's gonna stop me
Oh but I want

Babe I won't say no
Baby all I want is you

All the things that we could do

If you come in close

Pop,"""Now the words had all been spoken
And somehow the feeling still wasn't right
And still we continued on through the night
Tracing our steps from the beginning
Until they vanished into the air
Trying to understand
How our lives has lead us there

Looking hard into your eyes
There was nobody I'd ever known
Such an empty surprise to feel so alone
Now for me some words come easy
But I know that they don't mean that much
Compared with the things
That are said when lovers touch

You never knew what I loved in you
I don't know what you loved in me
Maybe the picture of somebody
You were hoping I might be
Awake again I can't pretend
And I know I'm alone and close to the end
Of the feeling we've known

How long have I been sleeping
How long have I been drifting
Alone through the night
How long have I've dreaming
I could make it right
If I closed my eyes
And tried with all my might
To be the one you need

Awake again I can't pretend
And I know I'm alone and close to the end
Of the feeling we've known
How long I've been sleeping
How long have I been drifting
Alone through the night
How long have I been running
For that morning flight
Through the whispered promises
And the changing light
Of the bed where we both lie
Late for the sky"""
Pop,"Hi my name is Becky and I approve this message

Abracadabra call me the mind master
I cast a spell on every beat
The rabbits out the hat, huh
Every show's a new surprise

Got all the fellas hypnotized by all my magic lines
I'm a magician yes, si soy un mago
Si quieres ver mi magia no mas me dices cuando
Soon you'll start to believe
Open your eyes and see, it's
Austin Mahone and Becky G

I got the magik in me
Every time I touch that track

I got some tricks up my sleeve
Just wait and see
Come a little closer
Close your eyes and count to three
Open, voilá, so espectacular
I even got magik to make the haters disappear
I've got my rhymes
They're like my special potions
And when I start to rap them
The whole track starts turning golden
And now I'm through

Pop,"Maybe things are not what they seem
And baby we know it
I feel like I`m wakin` up out of a dream
And we both want to control it
I don`t wanna make a wrong move
I don`t wanna lose a good groove
So baby let`s talk about it
Baby let`s think

Isn`t it love
Isn`t it love that we are feeling
Isn`t it love
Isn`t it love
Isn`t it time we stop concealing
Isn`t it love

We don`t have to love by the rules
So baby enjoy it
Bein` a fool for love don`t make us fools
Don`t let anyone destroy it
You need a home to run to
You need to have your fun too
So baby let`s talk about it
Baby let`s think

Isn`t it love
Isn`t it love that we are feeling
Isn`t it love
Isn`t it love
Isn`t it time we start revealing
Isn`t it love

And from the dawn of time
People lookin` for souls that rhyme
People lookin` people lookin` for souls that rhyme
But when our worlds collide
You gotta see it from a different side somehow
You just gotta say

We don`t wanna make a wrong move
We don`t wanna lose a good groove
So baby let`s talk about it
Talk to me and tell me how you feel
Can we really live without it
Baby let`s think

Isn`t it love
Isn`t it love that we are feeling
Isn`t it love
Isn`t it love
Isn`t it time we start the healing
Isn`t it love"
Pop,"Now when I've just begun to need you
Trying to throw everything away
No need to tell me, know you need time
Time for me to make you see you're always mine
Don't take your love away from me
Don't take your love away from me
Oh time after time when I thought we were close
Don't take your love away from me

Everyone is telling me to leave you
I'd love to know what you're doing now
I'm tempted to call round i'm tempted to phone
Just for you and me girl to be on our own

Don't take your love away from me
Don't take your love away from me, baby
Don't take your love away from me
Don't take your love away from me
Oh time after time when I thought we were close
Don't take your love away from me

Every time I'm lonely and I need you
Can I just call round and talk alone
I'm losing my will to live and people I know are telling me I've lost you girl
And there's no hope, so please

Don't take your love away from me
Don't take your love away from me
Don't take your love away from me
Don't take your love away from me
"
Pop,"So tell baby tell your true heart
Say what you say when you're all alone
I'm trying
Trying to try
And feel you
And see if I see
I'm feeling alone

And all I want is
To get through
So maybe you'll see that the way you're leaving me
It won't do
It's like I'm...

Refrão:
Blowing kisses in the wind
Givin' you love that you haven't been given
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'm only wishing you'd love me like I
Blowing kisses in the wind
Waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting for you is
It's like blowing, blowing kisses

So please, baby, please
Release me
If time after time your heart's growing cold
I'm saying
If you don't believe in believing, uh-uh
Then...how could true love ever be so

And all i want is
To get through
So maybe you'll see that the way you're leaving me
It won't do
It's like I'm...

Refrão

And all i want is
To get through
So maybe you'll see that the way you're leaving me
It won't do
It's like I'm...

Refrão"
Pop,"Boom boom boom clap
You're picture perfect blue
Sunbathing under moon
Star shining as your bones illuminate

First kiss no it was love
Under your influence
You take me over
You're the magic in my veins
This must be love

Boom clap
The sound in my heart
The beat goes on and on
And on and on and
Boom clap
You make me feel good
Come on with me, come on with me now
Boom clap

The sound in my heart
The beat goes on and on
And on and on and
Boom clap
You make me feel good
Come on with me, come on with me now

No silver or no gold
Could dress me up so good
You're the glitter in the darkness of my world
Just tell me what to do
I'll fall right into you
Going under cast a spell just say the world
I feel the love

Boom clap
The sound in my heart
The beat goes on and on
And on and on and
Boom clap
You make me feel good
Come on with me, come on with me now

Boom clap
The sound in my heart
The beat goes on and on
And on and on and
Boom clap
You make me feel good
Come on with me, come on with me now

You are the light and I will follow
You let me lose my shadow
You are the sun, the glowing halo
And you keep burning me up with all of your love"
Pop,"You and I
We belong
Still we always bring our bullshit home
Time is passing us by
Holding onto you tight
I ain't letting go
I just want you to know

You and me together it should work
But your mind is in another universe
Your ambition is a thing I like to see
Let me know, let me know
If you can find some time for me

How can we be strong
When the road is more than a million miles long
When the song is done
Will the love be gone?
Or should we forget it
Get it
Don't sweat it
Regret it
I ain't with it
Let's quit, quit it

Is it red, is it green
Am I stuck in between
It ain't black or white
Just ain't feeling right
But it ain't what it seems
Can you say what you mean
Tell me why this always happens to me

You and me together it should work
But your mind is in another universe
Your ambition is a thing I like to see
Let me know, let me know
If you can find some time for me

How can we be strong
When the road is more than a million miles long
When the song is done
Will the love be gone?
Or should we forget it
Get it
Don't sweat it
Regret it
I ain't with it
Let's quit, quit it

Missing you lately
All of the time
All you seem to do is argue
Make up your mind
Come to my yard
Bring all the man dem
The broke ass niggaz
With all the fake gem
Communication, that's what we need
All the silence makes my heart bleed
All you wanna do sit and burn weed
No R E S P E C T
Tell me what happens to our quality time
Everytime we meet
You're bringing trouble to my mind
A good man is so hard to find
Maybe we should dead this
Come back rewind

How can we be strong
When the road is more than a million miles long
When the song is done
Will the love be gone?
Or should we forget it
Get it
Don't sweat it
Regret it
I ain't with it
Let's quit, quit it

How can we be strong
When the road is more than a million miles long
When the song is done
Will the love be gone?
Or should we forget it
Get it
Don't sweat it
Regret it
I ain't with it
Let's quit, quit it
"
Pop,"I'm sorry
Haven't picked up when you call me lately
Just know that I've been thinking
'bout you daily
But not how I want to, no
Yeah something's been missing

(oh-way oh-way)
Feeling pressure from intentions
(oh-way oh-way)
In different perspectives
(oh-way oh-way)
Heavy hearted, what do I do now?

Cause you don't make me laugh
Like my x did, like my x did
It's tearing me in half
Like my x did, makes me so sick
Comparing you is wrong
But love's not fair at all
Cause you don't make me laugh
Like my x did, like my x did

Well I'm sorry
I've been dodging the truth for a minute
Running out of reasons to just roll with it
I'm surrounded by all your calls
Yeah something's been missing

(oh-way oh-way)
Feeling pressure from intentions
(oh-way oh-way)
In different perspectives
(oh-way oh-way)
Heavy hearted, what do I do now baby?

Cause you don't make me laugh
Like my x did, like my x did
It's tearing me in half
Like my x did, makes me so sick
Comparing you is wrong
But love's not fair at all
Cause you don't make me laugh
Like my x did, like my x did

Oh what do I do now?
What do I, what do I do now?
Oh no no no, what do I do now? (what do I do?)
What do I, what do I do now?
(what do I do? what do I do?)
What do I, what do I do?

Cause you don't make me laugh
Like my x did, like my x did
It's tearing me in half
Like my x did, makes me so sick
Comparing you is wrong
But love's not fair at all
Cause you don't make me laugh
Like my x did, like my x did

Comparing you is wrong
Love's not fair, love's not fair at all"
Pop,"Good girls are pretty like all the time
I'm just pretty some of the time
Good girls are happy and satisfied
I won't stop asking until i die

I just can't deal with the rules
I can't take the pressure
It's got me saying Ooo yeah

Chorus
Who's that girl? That you dream of
Who's that girl? That you think you love
Who's that girl? Well i'm nothing like her
I know there's no such girl
I swear I can't take the pressure
Who's that girl?

Good girls don't say no or ask you why
I won't let you love me, until
you really try (oh no)
Good girls are sexy like every day
I'm only sexy when i say it's ok

I just can't deal with the rules
I can't take the pressure
It's got me saying Ooo yeah

Chorus
Who's that girl? That you dream of
Who's that girl? That you think you love
Who's that girl? What if I'm not like her
I know there's no such girl
I swear i can't take the pressure
Who's that girl?

Let's play a game that you never tried
You be the girl and I'll be the guy
Let's pretend everything has changed
and then would you love me any different

I just can't deal with the rules
I can't take the pressure (oh no)
Who's that girl?

Chorus x 2
Who's that girl? That you dream of
Who's that girl? That you think you love
Who's that girl? What if I'm not like her
I know there's no such girl
I swear I can't take the pressure
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?"
Pop,"Don't miss you
When I'm alone
Don't see your face in places
We used to go
O-oh

Thought that I would feel nothing
If I ever saw you standing
In front of me
Don't know why I feel the shiver
Thought that we had frozen over
Now it's burning me
And it's hard to breathe

-
(Chorus)
There must've been a crack in the ice
But I can't remember
When I fell through
I don't know why we didn't survive
'Cos we held on tight
Feelings I'd forgotten
Buried deep under water
Pull me do-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-own
I thought that I could kill it but
This love won't dro-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-own
-

When I hear
Our favourite song
Don't reminisce
Just close my eyes and sing along
O-oh

You were lost and I was drifting
Thought that I could let the feeling
Wash over me
Try to keep it all together
But my heart is beating faster
I can't believe
You still get to me

(Chorus)

Go on dro-ow-ow-ow-own

If I just dive in
If I just dive in
Will I dro-ow-ow-own
If I just dive in
If I just dive in
Will I dro-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-owww-own

(Chorus)

Feelings pulling me
I wanna dro-ow-ow-ow-own"
Pop,"I hope everybody's havin' a merry christmas, I know I am, hey!
I feel good, I feel alright, hey!

Last night I couldn't believe my eyes, y'all
I saw a big fat man in a red disguise, y'all
He had a fuzzy white beard and big black boots
He had a pack on his back and red caboose, now... check this out
I tried to sleep, but my eyes wouldn't shut
You wouldn't believe it Mama, guess what!

Chorus:
Last night I saw Santa Claus
Sneakin' out of my back door
Last night I saw Santa Claus
What's he got in his great big bag for me?
What's he got for me?

He had crazy long hair and a red guitar, y'all
I never knew Santa Claus was a rock and roll star, now
Look-a-here... hey!
I asked my Mama could I join his band
She just screamed and yelled... she don't understand

Chorus
I wonder what he's got for me

Hey Jon, what's Santa doin'? He's pullin' somethin' out of his bag... what is it?
Uh, it looks like... a saxophone!
Hey Santa!

Look-a-here
I tried to sleep, but my eyes wouldn't shut
I told all my friends... guess what!

Chorus
I wonder what he's got for me

Blow, Santa!
Can't even sleep at night
Talkin' 'bout Santa Claus
Hey, ooh!
Play it one more time
Hey!
Sounds so good
Hey fellas, let's jam!"
Pop,"Between you and I,
And the starlight of the sky,
Nothin' and no one would ever know,
Galaxies high, you take me so fully,
As we jive through tonight,
Holdin' nothin' from eyes,

All I ever need, is you to take this crown,
Just lay me down,
All I have, is you to pull me through
This world that I'm in, my love,
Between you and I (Just you and I, Just you and I)
Baby, Just can't stop lovin' you,
Your kisses, are haunting my head
Between you and I darlin',
Nothin' could get better baby,
I just love when you call me lady,
oh ya know that drives me crazy

Violets are blue,
'N' every color, brings remnants of you,
Reach up and touch what you can feel,
Captivated, so surreal,
Drowning inside,
Of your soul that runs so deep,
As I'm lying here beside you, Infatuated, I'm so weak

All I ever need, is you to take this crown,
Just lay me down,
All I have, is you to pull me through
This world that I'm in, my love,
Between you and I (Just you and I, Just you and I)
Baby, Just can't stop lovin' you,
Your kisses, are haunting my head
Between you and I darlin',
Nothin' could get better baby,
I just love when you call me lady,
oh ya know that drives me crazy

Baby, please,
Say that you'll understand
That tonight, is a night, to love again,
Sweet memories,
of kisses we've blown in the wind,
And I'll cherish this quiet time we spend alone

Between you and I (Just you and I, Just you and I)
Baby, Just can't stop lovin' you,
Your kisses, are haunting my head
Between you and I darlin',
Nothin' could get better baby,
I just love when you call me lady,
oh ya know that drives me crazy"
Pop,"Just the other day somebody
Said to me,hey maybe you're slightly schizophrenic
And a little out of reach my friend
I said,yes that's partly true,
But jokes aside,I can explain,
It's just my way of keep in track with
Living on this planet now,then

Have you turned on your TV?
Have you seen reality?
Have you found the program,
That you spend your whole looking for?
There's a girl in Camden Town,
And decision makes her frown
Which dress would she wear today
And which way should she smiles at me?

Chorus:
How did it come to this?
How did it ever come to this?

All this noise and all this lies,
All this talking through the nights,
All this expectation now,
It's making me neurotic,tell me
Have I seen your face before?
Have forgot to say hello!
Thought I'd made it clear now,
That's I've always been a smiler,tell me

Chorus:
How did it come to this?
How did it ever come to this?
How did it come to this? (How did it come to this?)
How did it ever come to this?

Bridge:
Sometimes It's like I'm a world away
Sometimes I feel a world away

Just the other day somebody
Said to me,hey maybe you're also slightly
OCD,a little out of reach my friend
I said,yes that's partly true,
But jokes aside,please stay with me,
It's just my way of compartmentalising
All things I see

Chorus:
How did it come to this?
How did it ever come to this?
How did it come to this? (How did it come to this?)
How did it ever come to this?"
Pop,"Baby seems we never ever agree
You like the movies
And I like T.V.
I take thing serious
And you take 'em light
I go to bed early
And I party all night
Our friends are sayin'
We ain't gonna last
Cuz I move slowly
And baby I'm fast
I like it quiet
And I love to shout
But when we get together
It just all works out

I take--2 steps forward
I take--2 steps back
We come together
Cuz opposites attract
And you know--it ain't fiction
Just a natural fact
We come together
Cuz opposites attract

Who'd a thought we could be lovers
She makes the bed
And he steals the covers
She likes it neat
And he makes a mess
I take it easy
Baby I get obsessed
She's got the money
And he's always broke
I don't like cigarettes
And I like to smoke
Things in common
There just ain't a one
But when we get together
We have nothin' but fun

I take--2 steps forward
I take--2 steps back
We come together
Cuz opposites attract
And you know--it ain't fiction
Just a natural fact
We come together
Cuz opposites attract

Repeat Chorus

Baby ain't it somethin'
How we lasted this long
You and me
Provin' everyone wrong
Don't think we'll ever
Get our differences patched
Don't really matter
Cuz we're perfectly matched

Repeat chorus twice"
Pop,"Tryna force a puzzle piece
Not a perfect fit for me
But they told me give it time
Maybe Cupid missed my chest
Cause I keep looking left
And you ain't Mr. Right

You're so sweet when we're kissing
But there's something I'm missing
Baby there's no chemistry
Yeah, we look good on paper
You can call me a hater
But let's talk honestly

Hey, no you ain't the perfect match for me
But you were so close my Mr. Almost
I hope it didn't come off as a tease
You were so close my Mr. Almost

All my girls say lock him down
Guys like him don't come around
Go and pick your wedding rings
Yeah, my mom thinks you're legit
But I'm way too young for this
So I'ma tell you what I think

Yeah, you are so sweet when we're kissing
But there's something I'm missing
Baby there's no chemistry
Yeah, we look good on paper
You can call me a hater
But let's talk honestly

Hey, no you ain't the perfect match for me
But you were so close my Mr. Almost
I hope it didn't come off as a tease
You were so close my Mr. Almost

I know that this could be alarmin'
But you can't go and call me boo
I'm looking for my Prince Charming
You were so close my Mr. Almost

No, you ain't the perfect match for me
Oh, darling, you were so close my Mr. Almost

[Shy Carter]
Mister almost a billionaire
Mister almost yours til you almost caught feelings there.
Where?
Right there at the bluebird
When we were singing them songs we wrote
This is what you said and I quote
""I love you, baby, baby, so much, you're the one.
Ain?t nobody better than you up under the sun.""
This the part where I run, this the part where I dip
But I still love them hips

No, you ain't the perfect match for me

But you were so close my Mr. Almost
I hope it didn't come off as a tease
You were so close my Mr. Almost

I know that this could be alarmin'
But you can't go and call me boo
I'm looking for my Prince Charming
You were so close my Mr. Almost

No, you ain't the perfect match for me
Oh, darling, you were so close my Mr. Almost

Mister almost a billionaire"
Pop,"I'm not one to stick around
One strike and you're out, baby
Don't care if I sound crazy
But you never let me down
No, no
That's why when the sun's up I'm stayin'
Still layin' in your bed singin'
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Got all this time on my hands
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
I could stay here for a lifetime
So lock the door
And throw out the key
Can't fight this no more
It's just you and me
And there's nothing I, nothing I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So go ahead
And drive me insane
Baby, run your mouth
I still wouldn't change being
Stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you, baby
There's nowhere we need to be
No, no, no
I'ma get to know you better
Kinda hope you're here forever
Nobody on these streets
If you told me that the world was ending
Ain't no better way that I could spend it
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Got all this time on my hands
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
I could stay here forever
So lock the door
And throw out the key
Can't say this no more
It's just you and me
And there's nothing I, nothing I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So go ahead
And drive me insane
Baby, run your mouth
I still wouldn't change being
Stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you"
Pop,"we are the stupids group in the world.
we always copy backstreetboys.
we have not got a brain so:
we copy the best boyband in the world:the backstreet boys.
we are stupid and also gays
firs justin was a gay
then jc, joey
lance and chris.
we know that we suck
and also our 10 fans
thanks so much for being our fan
in this way
we learn that
only 10 people in the world are stupid because they love us.
"
Pop,"You should've written, me a letter
Instead of saying what you say
It could've turned out so much better
And now your words play inside my head
I thought that I was nothing mean
By setting you free
It seems the memories are dead
And now I'm out of my head
It's not how I planned it

You should be loving me
You should be holding me
Why do you choose
To turn yourself loose
Every word, means to me
Yet you try desperately
Turning away -
Baby, it's not that simple

For all the nights I lie here waiting
Morning finds me by myself
All you can say that I'm creating
My own sad match, my own hell

For all the loneliness I feel
I still want you here with me
When all the screaming is through
I've always been left with you
It's not what I wanted.

You should be loving me
You should be holding me
Why do you choose
To turn yourself loose
Every word, means to me
Yet you try desperately
Turning away -
Baby, it's not that simple

You should be loving me
You should be holding me
Why do you choose
To turn yourself loose
Every word, means to me
Yet you try desperately
Turning away -
Baby, it's not that simple

You should be loving me
You should be holding me
Why do you choose
To turn yourself loose
Every word, means to me
Yet you try desperately
Turning away -
Baby, it's not that simple"
Pop,"Fly me to the moon,
and let me play among the stars.
Let me see what spring is like
on Jupiter and Mars.
In other words,
Hold my hand.
In other words,
Baby, kiss me.

Fill my heart with song,
and let me sing forevermore.
You are all I long for,
all I worship and adore.

In other words,
please be true.
In other words,
I love you.

Fill my heart with song
and let me sing forevermore
you are all I long for
all I worship and adore.

In other words,
please be true.
In other words,
in other words,
In other words,
I love you."
Pop,"People see different things
When they look on the horizon
Do you see dark clouds rolling in fast
Cos baby they ain't gonna last

And I can't see anybody else
I can't stop looking at you
Take this dream and make it true

All I see is love, sweet love
On the horizon, oh yeah
Just one look in your deep brown eyes
And baby I'm flyin

This world could be so hard to take
Before I found you, I almost stopped trying
To see the good instead of the bad
But your hearts so true, that baby I'm cryin

And every single time we meet
I learn what love is for
It's taking less and giving more

All I see is love, sweet love
On the horizon, oh yeah
Just one look in your deep brown eyes
And baby I'm flyin

And baby I don't wanna see pain in your eyes
Cos you're the one that sets me free
There's nothing in this world that can hurt us
If it's you and me, hey-yeah-yeah

All I see is love, sweet love
On the horizon, oh yeah
Just one look in your deep brown eyes
And baby I'm flyin

All I see is love, sweet love
On the horizon, oh yeah
(All i see is love on the horizon)
Just one look in your deep brown eyes
And baby I'm flyin

I-I'm, flyin baby
(All I see is love on the horizon)
I-I'm, flyin baby

All I see is love, sweet love
On the horizon, oh yeah
Just one look in your deep brown eyes
And baby I'm flyin

"
Pop,"The life I've always wanted
I guess I'll never have
I'll be working for somebody else
Until I'm in my grave
I'll be dreaming of a life of ease
And mountains o'things

To have a big expensive car
Drag my furs on the ground
And have a maid that I can tell
To bring me anything
Everyone will look at me with envy and with greed
I'll revel in their attention
And mountains
Oh mountains o'things

Sweet lazy life
Champagne and caviar
I hope you'll come and find me
Cause you know we are
Those who deserve the best in life
And know what money's worth
And those whose sole misfortune
Was having mountains o' nothing at birth

Oh they tell me
There's still time to save my soul
They tell me
Renouce all
Renouce all those material things you gained by
Exploiting other human beings

Consume more than you need
This is the dream
Make your pauper
Or make you queen
I won't die lonely
I'll have it all prearranged
A grave that's deep and wide enough
For me and all my mountains o' things

Mostly I feel lonely
Good good people are
Good people are only
My stepping stones
It's gonna take all my mountains o' things
To surround me
Keep all my enemies away
Keep my sadness and loneliness at bay

I'll be dreaming, dreaming, dreaming....
Dreaming...."
Pop,"Dear darlin', please excuse my writing
And I can't stop my hands from shaking
'Cause I'm cold and alone tonight

I miss you and nothing hurts like no you
And no one understands what we went through
It was short, it was sweet, we tried

And if my words break through the wall
And meet you at your door
All I can say is ""Girl, I mean them all""

Dear darlin', please excuse my writing
I can't stop my hands from shaking
'Cause I'm cold and alone tonight

I miss you and nothing hurts like no you
And no one understands what we went through
It was short, it was sweet, we tried
We tried

(I understand where he's coming from)

Been thinking about the bar we drank in
Feeling like the sofa was sinking
I was warm in the hope of your eyes

So if my words break through the wall
To meet you at your door
All I can say is ""Girl, I mean them all""

Dear darlin', please excuse my writing
I can't stop my hands from shaking
'Cause I'm cold and alone tonight

I miss you and nothing hurts like no you
And no one understands what we went through
It was short, it was sweet, we tried

Oh I concur
These arms are yours to hold

And I miss you and nothing hurts like no you
And no one understands what we went through
It was short, it was sweet, we tried
We tried"
Pop,"Yo yo
Yo yo
Here to make a mixtape I'll do it labels
Say give more take influence

All the young singers
All the new rappers
It's the first chapter, welcome

Open up your textbook
Page 50
I can see the future
I made history

Started with the guitar
Singing in the kitchen
Mommie yelling at me
I told just listen

Was in trouble so I had to make a smile
Cuz accidently broke my new laptop
Like wooooou, big dummy

She was using curse words and I
Can't repeat'em
But that was what, she first heard
Started believing

She was lookint at me...
Anger went to happy...perfect

That's what my music did
You can never run in it
Put my life on the
Pafes in why I'm doing it

I had to make a song for you
And then my show is sing along with you

The music is...what I need everyday
So let this
Song fade away
When life is getting in the way
No, no

Novacane ooh ooh
Novacane
Ooh baby
Novacane
All the music is my novacane
Ooh baby

My heart's in music
So I'm never dying
Doesn't matter if I barely
Stop trying

Tought myself to sing
Sing along with brandy's
Studied every wrong
Cuz I'm trying win a grammy

I'm getting better
But I always stay humble
And daddy say
Pick it up if I fumble

Rapping's in my blood
I've been doing this forever
Only been around
About a decade... whathever

Age doesn't matter
Lighter do the spotlight
I was made for this
Game no stop lights

Keep going even
If the race's done
I'm writing songs
Till I finally place one

They take the money
Send my family on vacation
I ain't leving whole
Word is wasting

This is just simple
Album coming soon
Teen in the city
Make some room

That was my music
Did you can never run in it
Put my life on the pages
Is why I'm doing it

I had to make a song for you
And then my show is sing along with you

The music is...what I need everyday
So let this
Song fade away
When life is getting in the way
No, no

Novacane ooh ooh
Novacane
Ooh baby
Novacane
All the music is my novacane
Ooh baby

Novacane
Ooh
Novacane
Ooh baby
Novacane
All the music is my
Novacane

Pop,"Come inside, I'll take your coat
Leave your broken outside
I'll close the door
I know that it's hard to do, being you
It's a lonely road so let me bring you home

Don't look back
Don't you ever give your heartache away
''cause I got you baby
You can give it all to me
And I'll hold it safely
You know you can count on me

So close your eyes, dive, let go of it all
Believe you will survive
Let love break the fall
I won't let go
I won't let go, no
If I'm just here to give you love
Then that's what I'm here to do, to do
If I'm loving you better that's cool, cool
Don't tell me what I could lose oh oh
If I'm loving you better that's cool, cool
If I'm loving you

Tonight we can take it slow
You need a shoulder to cry on, let me know
Whatever I gotta do
I'll pull you through it
It's a lonely road but I can bring you home

Don't look back
Don't you ever give your heartache away
''cause I got you baby
You can give it all to me

If I'm loving you
Loving you

Think of nothing darling
Lay down your head, I've got it
For all the things you've done
I'll pay you back with love
And don't you worry about the pressure
''cause I can make it better
Lean on my love
Let me take away your pain

So close your eyes, dive, let go of it all
Believe you will survive
Let love break the fall

Pop,"First off
Give a girl some credit
I'm gonna keep on loving you
Cause you be the realest, all day and all night
And that's how you stay by my side

I don't always do the right thing
It doesn't matter, 'cause nobody's perfect here, no
If you're leaving, I can't make you stay

Where you going, where you tryna go?
Where you going, where you tryna go?

Sit yourself down, cause you know you're gonna stay
Boy, you better listen to the words I say
You ain't going nowhere
You ain't going nowhere
Boy, you better act
Like you got some sense
Cause you got a dime
And that's money well spent
You ain't going nowhere
You ain't going nowhere

We'll be here all day
If you start pointing fingers my way
I just wished you love me, love me, baby
If you can do that then I'll do the same, yeah

We can make it work, baby
We'd be crazy if we don't try
Love and hate is such a thin line

Where you going, where you tryna go?
Where you going, where you tryna go?
Baby, baby
Where you going, where you tryna go?
Where you going, where you tryna go?

Sit yourself down, cause you know you're gonna stay

And that's money well spent
You ain't going nowhere
You ain't going nowhere

If you're waiting for me
You're gonna be waiting all night
If you're gonna play games, you're gonna lose
You'll be sorry if you say goodbye
Yeah, I still want you, but I don't need you
You should be happy
I'm still here for you
I don't have to be
You must be blind if you can't see

Where you going, where you tryna go?
Where you going, where you tryna go?
Baby, baby
Where you going, where you tryna go?
Where you going, where you tryna go?
Baby

Sit yourself down, cause you know you're gonna stay

Why I let go, let go, let go
When you're the only one I wanna hold

Pop,"Here

Up and down
I love a merry-go-round
You went your way, I went my way
Said you'll see me down life's highway

Not black or white
As chrystal clear as a cloudy night
Traveling in the name of lonely
I was only home when you held me

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time
To emerge from the shadows
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time
To come knocking at my door

And it's here,
Where I've come home to.
Right here
Everything I hold on to is here
All the things I keep so dear.

Flying home tonight
As far away as a satelite
Keeping your heart in my pocket
Hope to God that I don't drop it

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time
To emerge from the shadows
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time
To come bursting through my door

And it's here,

where I've come home to
Right here
Everything I hold on to is here
All the things I keep so dear
I hear

Oh what a time to come back
Oh what a time to come home
Oh what a time to come back
Oh what a time

Up and down,
I love a merry-go-round
You went your way, I went my way
Said you'll see my down life's highway

To emerge from the shadows
yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time
To come knocking at my door

And it's here,

Everybody's walking 'round
Everybody's dreaming'bout"
Pop,"She said baby baby
I know what you want and I'm sure
That it's time for you to try
And get yourself the things that are yours

'Cause it could be gone in the blink of an eye
It could be dawn in the blink of an eye
Isn't it time that you reached for the sky
And let yourself go

I been crazy baby
I know what you mean and I swear
That if there's a song in the night
You know I've gotta hear it out there

'Cause it could be gone in the blink of an eye
It could be dawn in the blink of an eye
Isn't it time that you reached for the sky
And let yourself go
There's a fire deep inside

I said baby baby
Let's steal the moon and let love have it's way
Burning like a falling star until we are
A million miles away

It could be gone in the blink of an eye
It could be dawn in the blink of an eye
Isn't it time that you reached for the sky
And let yourself go now
There's a fire deep inside
Let yourself go now
And forget the fears you hide
Let yourself go now
And forget the tears you cried

And when you needed me
Did I just turn away
And when I spoke my heart
Is there something I forgot to say"
Pop,"Kings and Queens and Presidents
Ministers of Governments
Welcome to the future of your world
Through talking heads that took liberties
The monkeys learnt to build machines
They think they'll get to heaven through the universe
They say nothing
Deny everything
And make counter accusations
My friends, my dear, my love, my God

There'll be trouble when the kidz come out (Come out)
There will be lots for them to talk about (About)
There'll be trouble when the kidz come out
When the kidz come out

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
What you looking at
Hey, hey, hey, hey
You want a bit of that
Hey, hey, hey, hey
There will be trouble when the kidz come out
When the kidz come out
Hey

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all?
The Good, the Bad, the Ugly or the Beautiful
Because it's uphill and against the wind
With no-one there to let us in
Leave your thoughts and save yourself, you fool

The daggers of science
Evolving into violence
We're not sure where the fallout blows
But we all know

There'll be trouble when the kidz come out (Come out)
There will be lots for them to talk about (About)
There'll be trouble when the kidz come out

Out on the streets tonight
They're making peace tonight
They're making peace...

La, la, la, la...

There'll be trouble when the kidz come out
There will be lots for them to talk about
There'll be trouble when the kidz come out
When the kidz come out
When the kidz come out
There'll be trouble when the kidz come out.

Pop,"Love and hate
Their turns, they wait
When next I come to Orchart Street
I'll use my key
I'll enter soft on stocking feet to see
If you have told the truth to me

Hate and love
They push, they shove
They use my life just like a toy
They take my mind
They must enjoy their puppet on a wire
Until I'm nothing but desire

Love and hate
We meet, we mate
We give ourselves to fantasies
Of who we wish our loves could be
And sometimes in the dark
We accidentally find a heart"
Pop,"A one God's lottery, dad's still watchin' me
That's comradery, woah, woah, woah
The game ain't new to me, you're nothin' they can do to me
I ain't gotta wear jewelry, I still shine
I still shine on 'em, woo
Hair; curly, I look like Zeus
I'm Omar Epps, I got the juice
I feel like the bars, go tell Bruce
I'm gettin' close to the truth

I think I got angels watching
My life just keeps on unlocking
I'm gonna make it to the other side
I think I got angels watching

Ladies and Gentlemen pose, back with the real
Second meditation, tryna catch me a feel
A little bit of presence is all it took
Be here longer than a day, the Foster Wallace book
Nothing's Trump's time, ever
Most underrated, Kawhi Leonard
George Muresan, I'm centered
Welcome to the world, fourth trimester
Tom Hanks [?]
Don't know where I am, but I'm headed home
I might pop up in your city, dog, you never know
And don't forget change, it's like a metronome
And the beard is like war paint
Duke Game is my only court date
Outside all year, walkin' towards faith
My North face is in [?]
They shouldn't never let me read Barhaze
The breakup hit me in a sore place
This is now a one horse race
Everybody love me like my name is King George Strait, woo

I think I got angels watching
My life just keeps on unlocking
I'm gonna make it to the other side
I think I got angels watching, woah"
Pop,"Your wants desires
Needs and wishes
Will be duly noted
Processed filed and cataloged
Labeled and encoded
Turned into sitcom dialog
And advertising slogans

We've got a box to put in your brain
Hard wired for downloading
All the secrets and the mysteries
You've been selfishly withholding

The dreams and hopes
That once were yours
Will now be collected and dispersed
So the first to come with cash to spend
Will be the first one served

We've got a box to put in your brain
Hard wired for downloading
All the secrets and the mysteries
You've been selfishly withholding

Make you think you like to be watched
Displayed on the auction block
Invaded in your own home
Stripped naked on the television
Humiliated in front of millions

We've got a box to put in your brain
Hard wired for downloading
All the secrets and the mysteries
You've been selfishly withholding

We've got a box to put in your brain
We've got a box to put in your brain
We've got a box to put in your brain
We've got a box to put in your brain

Pop,"It only takes a minute girl
(music)
It only takes a minute girl
To fall in love, to fall in love
It only takes a minute girl
To fall in love, to fall in love

What's an hour of the day
We throw at least one away
And walk the streets for half the year
To try to find a new career
If you get a flu attack
For thirty days you're on your back
Doing not a single dance
Baby give me half a chance

It only takes a minute girl
To fall in love, to fall in love
It only takes a minute girl
To fall in love, to fall in love

Now in the unemployment lines
You can spend your life reading signs
Waiting for your interview
They can shoot the whole day for you

Now winter's gonna turn to spring
And you haven't accomplished a thing
So baby can't you make me just a little time
Cause you never know what's on my mind

It only takes a minute girl
To fall in love, to fall in love
It only takes a minute girl
To fall in love, to fall in love

Dance, come on now
Dance, come n now

Pop,"When the day is dawning
on a Texas Sunday morning,
how I long to be there
with Marie who’s waitin’ for me there.
Every lonely city
where I hang my hat,
ain’t as half as pretty
as where my baby’s at.

Is this the way to Amarillo?
Every night I’ve been hugging my pillow
dreaming dreams of Amarillo
and sweet Marie who waits for me.
Show me the way to Amarillo
I’ve been weepin’ like a willow
crying over Amarillo
and sweet Marie who waits for me.

Sha la la la la la la la
and Marie who waits for me.

There’s a church bell ringing,
hear the sound of joy that it’s singing
for the sweet Maria
and the guy who’s comin’ to see her.
Just beyond the highway
lies an open plain
and it keeps me going
through the wind and rain.

Is this the way to Amarillo?............."
Pop,"Look
I know girls love Beyoncé
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing and shawty
You ain't no different
These days it's hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I've been avoiding commitment
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone
But if you're alone then

Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

Say my name, say my name
'Cause those other men are practice
And this ain't no time for actin'
And this ain't no time for games
And this ain't no time for uncertainty
And this ain't no time for locking your phone
and not coming home and startin' some shit
when I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me

Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips
that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys 'round me saying
""Get money and fuck these hoes""
Where we learn these values?
I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone
besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more
Plus you're not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I'm not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name

Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you"
Pop,"Magnolia trees at night
Sparkling bright
Fields of cotton look Wintery white
When it's Christmas time in New Orleans

A barefoot choir in prayer
Fills the air
Mississippi folks are gathering there
When it's Christmas time in New Orleans

You'll see a dixieland Santa Claus
Leading the band
To a good old Creole beat
And golly what a spirit
You can only hear it
Down on Basin Street
Your cares will disappear
When you hear
Hallelujah, St. Nicholas is here
When it's Christmas time in New Orleans

Oh yeah baby

You'll see a dixieland Santa Claus
Leading the band

And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see

So darling, darling
Stand by me, oh, stand by me
Oh stand, stand by me
Stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

Oh stand by me
oh won't you stand now?

Pop,"Help me escape this feeling of insecurity,
I need you so much, but I don't think you really need me.
But if we all stand up in the name of love,
and state the case of what we're dreaming of,
I've got to say I only dream of you,
But like a thief in the night you took away the love that I knew.
Relight my fire,
your love is my only desire.
Relight my fire,
'cos I need your love.
Turn back the times till the days when our love was new.
(Do you remember?)
No matter what was happening I was there with you.
But if we all stand up for what we believe,
and maybe live within our possibilities,
the world would be wild for the dream,
so baby, don't turn away,
listen to what I got to say.
Relight my fire,
your love is my only desire.
Relight my fire, 'cos I need
Relight my fire,
your love is my only desire.
Relight my fire, 'cos I need oh I need your love.
You got to be strong enough to walk on through the night,
there's a new day on the other side.
You got to have hope in your soul, just keep on walking.
Strong enough to walk on through the night,
Thereee's a new day on the other side,
and I got hope in my soul,
well I keep walking baby, keep on walking baby.
Relight my fire,
your love is my only desire.

I thought she knew

I thought she knew
My world revolved around her
My love light burned for her alone
But she couldn't see the flame
Only myself to blame

Pop,"There's a brand new light in my life
Shines after the candle is out at night
It's gotten the best of me
It's got my heart and it won't set it free
I just can't tell you why
If I did, well it might be a lie

It's a long world we're living in
I've got to have her from beginning to end
It's long world we're living in
I just can't live without her


Does anybody know how it feels to want her this bad
So bad you'd give your life away
There's gotta be somebody somewhere
Who needs someone like I need you


And I wait for the day to take her away in vain
And I realize I'll always feel the same

Felt so good even though she did me wrong
She knows what I want but she's bad for me
She gets what she wants when she's touching me

You can take, my heart, like a criminal

From the trail of broken heart

Animal instinct for real
Drive her crazy, she knows the deal

(Conor Maynard)

You can take, my heart, like a criminal

So grab me by the neck and don't you ever let go
Mess me up so good until I'm beggin' for more
Girl, tear, me apart, like an animal
Like an animal, animal"
Pop,"I know I shouldn't be doing this
Why can't I stop?
Butterfly blood rush everything's telling me to run
But I'm not

You only regret what you don't do
Why don't we do what we want to now?
Don't give me time to back out

Cause I don't wanna think about
Waking up, making up lies
Trying to pretend that we didn't do what we're doing
I don't wanna think about
Real life, not tonight I don't wanna think about anyone,
Anything, anyway

If there's a chance we'll break
I wanna smash into pieces
Let's make a big mistake
But I don't want to think about it
I don't wanna think about it

My heart beats my head
And I'm letting it take me over
I gotta keep going can't stop can't sleep
Cause tomorrow I'll be sober

You only regret what you don't do
Why don't we do what we want to now?
Don't give me time to back out

Cause I don't wanna think about
Waking up, making up lies
Trying to pretend that we didn't do what we're doing
I don't wanna think about
Real life, not tonight I don't wanna think about anyone,
Anything, anyway

If there's a chance we'll break
I wanna smash into pieces
Let's make a big mistake
But I don't want to think about it
I don't wanna think about it

Only regret the things that you don't do
Do do do what you want to
Only regret the things that you don't do
Do do do what you want to

I wanna feel something I've never felt before
And I don't care if hurts, it's worth it, yeah
I wanna be someone I've never been before
So I'm gonna run and I'm gonna close my eyes
I'm gonna jump into the fire

Cause I don't wanna think about
Waking up, making up lies
Trying to pretend we didn't do what we're doing
I don't wanna think about
Real life, not tonight I don't wanna think about anyone,
Anything, anyway

If there's a chance we'll break
I wanna smash into pieces
Let's make a big mistake
But I don't want to think about it
I don't wanna think about it

Only regret the things that you don't do
Do do do what you want to
Only regret the things that you don't do
Do do
Let's do what we want to"
Pop,"tell me baby baby (tell me baby)

Pop,"Mmmmm oh yeah..

Oh water, I don't need no lemonade

Chorus:

Here come the girls! (Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls)
Here come the girls! (Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls)
Here come the girls! (Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls)
Here come the girls! (Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls)

(Heidi): Slippin' on my little black dress
5 inches I'm bound to impress
Turn it up, I'm a little temptress
Monroe's got nothin' on me
Read my curves like poetry
Tonight we rule the world, beware cos here come the girls
Tonight we rule the world, beware cos here come the girls

[Chorus]

(Amelle): Here the whistle as I walk by
Shine like a crystal all through the night
One look will make a grown man cry
Step aside I got a starring role
Camera, action, here we go
Tonight we rule the world, beware cos here come the girls!

[Chorus]

(Keisha): I'm filled with sexuality
With or without a man I feel complete
Stop speculating, I'm a regular girl
All independant women know
We got the guts to run the show
Don't let no boy tell you nothing
You're in control

[Chorus x2]"
Pop,"Driving home, replaying all the things he said
I thought I'd feel different that this
I can't explain or ignore this emptiness
But it felt right in the moment

When he looked in my eyes
It almost felt like someone cared
And when he help me tight
It felt like someone was there for me
And I, I wish I could say that he stayed
But he runs every time, like that he's gone

And I know it wasn't much
And I know it from his touch
There's no truth in is eyes, but
I want this to be real, so bad
And I know that's not enough
And I held on for too long
It was broken and wrong
It was nothing at all
But I felt a lot like love

And I can feel him add my name to his list
I'm nothing more than a number
But I'll admit, I'd still do anything
Just to feel that feeling once more
Cause when he looked in my eyes
I swear he set my world on fire
And whe he held me tight
It felt like I was the only one

And I, I wish I could say that he stayed
But he runs every time, like that he's gone
And I know it wasn't much
And I know it from his touch
There's no truth in is eyes, but
I want this to be real, so bad
And I know that's not enough
And I held on for too long
It was broken and wrong
It was nothing at all
But I felt a lot like love

It if was love, he wouldnt've left me lonely
And if it was love, he would've
Cared that he hurt me
They say love it patient, love is kind
But in this love I'm slowly losing my mind
I lose my mind

When he looked in my eyes
It almost felt like someone cared
And I know it wasn't much
And I know it from his touch
There's no truth in is eyes, but
I want this to be real, so bad
And I know that's not enough

And I held on for too long
It was broken and wrong
It was nothing at all
But I felt a lot like love
But I felt a lot like love
It was nothing at all
But I felt a lot like love"
Pop,"My, my soul mate are you (I like you)
I am afraid of losing you (But I like you)
I only think of you (I love you) , Only you
My heart only beats for you (I love you)
And I never will forget you (Because I love you)
But I only like you (I think in you) , Only you
Oh oh oh uh oh (3x) Think about this
Just don't hurt me, yeah

I cannot live, without you near me
I cannot dream, without have you for me
I cannot walk, with you long way of me
I cannot talk, if you can't see me

You're everything for me (I don't hate you)
With you I have no fear (But I don't hate you)
Because you are (I adore you) a heroine of my life
You conquered me (I adore you)
And now I can see (But I adore you)
That you love me (I wanna kiss you)
Yes! You Love Me
Oh oh oh uh oh (3x) Think about this
Just don't hurt me, yeah

I cannot live, without you near me
I cannot dream, without have you for me
I cannot walk, with you long way of me
I cannot talk, if you can't see me"
Pop,"Too long i've been, denying myself
hostage to thoughts on somebody else
and all the while you have been wishing to,
love on me
mixed feelings and misgivings
that's all a memory now, babe
when you saw me for what i could be
then i finally saw the same

Now the lover in me sees the lover in you
and i'm happy to say
that i'm so not afraid
for the lover in me to meet the lover in you
cause i see what will be
and the lover in me loves you

The past is just thaat, leave it where its at
I want to live in the moment with you
wasted so much time startling but now i'm
spreading my wings and beginning again
mixed feeling and misgivings
that's all a memory now babe
when you saw me for what i could be
then i finally saw the same

Now the lover in me is the lover in you
and i'm happy to say
that i'm so not afraid
for the lover in me to meet the lover in you
cause i see what will be
and the lover in me loves you

don't have nothing left to cry
your my strongest half
so amazing how you are taking me away
i'm too far off the ground
i don't have to tell me now
just let me, oh let me
feel like i'm never gonna come down

Now the lover in me is the lover in you
and i'm happy to say
that i am sort of a afraid
now the lover in me has made the lover in you
cause i see what will be
and the lover in me loves you (x3)"
Pop,"I never knew that we were through, I was too fallen and fallen for you
You walked away, out of my life, nothing to say
Couldn't deny, or ask you why, why you were telling me lie after lie
Without a sign, no longer mine, it was good-bye

Did you think I couldn't live without you?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
And listen baby, I, I was right, to doubt you
I can live without you by my side

(Now you're gone) And the days are getting brighter
(Now you're gone) And the writings on the wall
(Now you're gone) Now my heart is out of danger
(Now you're gone) I have no regrets at all

I have no fear, my conscience is clear, won't let your memory drive me to tears
Suddenly now, I understand why you are gone
A bittersweet revenge, in the end, is a heart that can grow on command
Take it from me, I'm mov-ing on.

Did you think I couldn't live without you?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Now listen baby, I, I was right, to doubt you
I can live without you by my side

(Now you're gone) And the days are getting brighter
(Now you're gone) And the writings on the wall
(Now you're gone) Now my heart is out of danger
(Now you're gone) I have no regrets at all


I've been thinking about you night and day, all the time that we spent, just thrown away
I've been thinking about how you tried to break my heart
Now I've finally found the strength to say, that letting you go is the only way
I've decided today is the day to move on

Did you think I couldn't live without you?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Now listen baby, I, I was right, to doubt you
I can live without you by my side

(Now you're gone) And the days are getting brighter
(Now you're gone) And the writings on the wall
(Now you're gone) Now my heart is out of danger
(Now you're gone) I have no regrets at all

Now you're gone..."
Pop,"Stop it! Stop it, Girl!
Stop it! Stop it, Girl!

I said stop it, girl. Look what you're doing to me
It's just not right. Can't you see?
This ain't the way it's supposed to be,
I should be lovin' you and you lovin' me


(mechanical voice) Stop Girl, before he breaks your heart


Stop girl, before he breaks your heart
I'm the one who loves you, right from the start
Stop girl, don't let him bring you down
I'm the one who loves you and I'll be around


He could never love you like I love you, girl
He could never say the things, like I need you in my world
Girl, I really love you, but you won't give me your time
You tell me that he loves you so and you can't make up your mind


Girl, he's not true
None of his love is for you
It's all not true
It's not true, baby
OOOOOOOH


Chorus

I guess I'm gonna love you for my whole life long
Girl, he's not the one for you, I can tell you nothing wrong
Tell me that you love me, let me take you by the hand
Girl, my love is oh so true, try and understand


Girl, it's so true
All of my lovin' for you
It's all so true
So true, Baby
OOOOOOOH


Stop it, Girl!
Stop it, Girl
(Electric guitar bridge)


Stop Girl, before he breaks your heart
(Don't let him break your heart)
I'm the one that loves you, right from the start
(Right from the start)
Stop Girl, don't let him bring you down
(don't let him bring you down)
I'm the one that needs you and I'll be around
(I'll be around)
Stop it Girl, before he breaks your heart
(Oh Baby)

Don't let him
Don't let him
Don't let him
Bring you down"
